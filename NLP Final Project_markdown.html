/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<h3 id="Homework-Prompt:">Homework Prompt:<a class="anchor-link" href="#Homework-Prompt:">&#182;</a></h3><p>Illinois is famous for being one of the very few states in the country with negative population growth.  The objective of your final project is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the key reasons for the declining population by extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text<br></li>
<li>Provide actionable recommendations on what can be done to reverse this trend<br></li>
<li>You have a collection of ~30 days’ worth of news articles in RCC located at: /home/kadochnikov/news/news_chicago_il.pkl – related to either Chicago and / or Illinois.<br></li>
</ul>
<p>To complete your assignment, I suggest considering the following steps:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Clean-up the noise (eliminate articles irrelevant to the analysis)<br></li>
<li>Detect major topics<br></li>
<li>Identify top reasons for population decline (negative sentiment)<br></li>
<li>Suggest corrective actions<br></li>
<li>Demonstrate how the city / state can attract new businesses (positive sentiment)<br></li>
<li>Leverage appropriate NLP techniques to identify organizations and people and apply targeted sentiment<br></li>

2 Chicago Music Exchange Memphis coming to an end:( - Page 3 Chicago Music Exchange Memphis coming to an end Its really disappointing to me how these posts drift off topicand involve politics and  after the fact opinions on the CME blowout sale.CME clearly disclosed these guitars as  floor models  with some issues and were priced accordingly . So you either participated or you didnt period They also have a risk free refund policy that they honored admirably. They certainly cannot be expected to anticipate the subjectivity of every buyer  as it relates to a floor model with some issues.Some of these issues were slight , some more obvious the later of which should have been caught during pre delivery inspection and I agree with the overall sentiment regarding those obvious unplayable issues.Nonetheless  many of us , including myself had to return a guitar for various reasons , but in the end my inconvenience , and participation in this sale was rewarded by the receipt of a gorgeous figured light burst 335 , that plays like butter and screams 60s Gibson tone . Cost 1600  well worth it to me.As for online purchases  get use to it local retail stores cannot carry the inventory, or have 5 or 6 of a particular model for the discriminating buyer to sort through to find the perfect guitar.No complaints here  thank you CME and Gibson for this opportunity.

Paul Bauer, left, takes part in the arrest of a protester outside an Apple store on Magnificent Mile in Chicago. Promoted to commander, Bauer, 53, a 31year veteran...   By DON BABWINAssociated Press CHICAGO AP  A police commander who was killed after a foot chase in downtown Chicago was shot in the head by a suspect carrying a semiautomatic handgun equipped with an extended clip of ammunition, a police official told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The official, who was briefed on the investigation, spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to provide such details until charges are filed against the suspect in the death of Cmdr. Paul Bauer. Bauer, who had been on the police force for 31 years, was shot Tuesday afternoon after spotting a man matching the radio description of an armed suspect, Chicago police have said. The official told the AP that Bauer, 53, had identified himself as a police officer and was trying to trying to detain the suspect when they got into a physical fight and fell down a stairwell that led to a locked underground walkway. Police spokesman Frank Giancamilli would not comment on the weapon but said the suspect was wearing a bulletproof vest under a heavy coat when he was arrested. The Chicago Police Department has said tactical officers had detained the suspect outside the James R. Thompson Center government building when the man fled. Officers initially confronted the suspect because he was acting suspiciously, according to police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. Some initial media reports said the suspect may have been involved in the robbery of a local business, but Johnson did not provide details about what the man was doing that prompted officers to want to speak with him. Officers had been chasing the man on foot when Bauer saw the offender and engaged in an armed physical confrontation, Johnson said Tuesday afternoon. Police captured the suspect a short time later, and a gun was recovered at the scene, he said. I just ask the citizens of this city to keep the Bauer family in their prayers, said Johnson, who choked back tears as he spoke to reporters outside the hospital where Bauer had been pronounced dead. It was initially reported that Bauer was off duty, but police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter late Tuesday that Bauer was on duty. He said in an email Wednesday that it was a chaotic scene and Bauer had been attending training at the Chicago Fire Department with other officials before the shooting. There was no communication from him on the radio informing dispatch that he was in pursuit of the offender or that he was even on scene, so they initially thought it was an offduty officer until someone recognized him, Guglielmi wrote. Mayor Rahm Emanuel called Bauers death a tragic reminder of the dangerous duty the men and women of our police department accept to ensure the safety of us all. Noreen Danko was on her way to her office nearby when she heard the gunshots. I was walking down the street and I heard pop pop pop pop pop, Danko told the Chicago Tribune. And I said to the girl next to me, Is that what I think it is And she said, Yep. I said, Aw geez. And everybody is scurrying all over and I see the police head to the stairs there. She said she saw officers lead the shackled suspect away and put him in a squad car, then watched as emergency workers administered CPR to Bauer, who was lying on a stretcher, before he was put inside an ambulance and rushed to the hospital. ___ This story has been corrected to indicate that the commander was on duty, not off duty, based on updated information from police.

11 ADMBunge deal would create Cargill-sized agribusiness giant - Chicago Tribune The world of agriculturalcommodity trading could be upended with the merger of two of its biggest names. ArcherDanielsMidland Co. has sought deal talks with Bunge Ltd., a person briefed on the matter said at the weekend. Thats less than a year after Glencore approached Bunge about a deal. What ADMBunge would look like: While theyre not exactly household names, ADM and Bunge have been around for 116 years and 200 years respectively and are among the very largest buyers and sellers of grains and other crops.But both companies do a lot more than that: they crush soybeans, produce vegetable oil and supply biofuels  ADM even has a unit that manufacturers flavors. So, on paper at least, a combined ADMBunge would be both a commoditytrading giant, with an international network of barges and marine terminals, and a major industrial enterprise with factories and refineries.Where they really differ is geographic footprint. Bunge has a much larger presence in South America, while ADM is bigger in the U.S. Combining the two would create a company that, at least in terms of revenue, would be approaching the size of Cargill Inc., the largest agricultural company.Why now First, times are tough for crop traders. A glut isnt only depressing prices but also sapping volatility, which is bad news for grain merchants like ADM and Bunge, as well as Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Corp., the four storied trading houses known in the industry as the ABCDs.Bunge is the smallest of the four traders and theyve struggled to turn around the ship, Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.ADM last year cut jobs and reshuffled management, while White Plains, New Yorkbased Bunge slashed its profit guidance several times and unveiled a plan to eliminate 250 million in costs. A merger is an obvious way to accelerate and deepen such savings. Soren Schroder, Bunges chief executive officer, acknowledged last year that industry consolidation may be needed amid such challenging conditions.Ryan Ori Archer Daniels Midland doesnt plan to shutter a wheat mill in the Fulton Market district until 2019. But with real estate values soaring in the area, the agribusiness giant isnt waiting to cash in with a sale of the 2.2acre property.Chicagobased ADM and Larry Goldwasser, one of the Cushman...Archer Daniels Midland doesnt plan to shutter a wheat mill in the Fulton Market district until 2019. But with real estate values soaring in the area, the agribusiness giant isnt waiting to cash in with a sale of the 2.2acre property.Chicagobased ADM and Larry Goldwasser, one of the Cushman...Ryan Ori Second, ADM is likely to be acting on the knowledge that Glencore could come back again after its initial approach. Whats next ADM or Bunge have declined to comment on their potential merger. All eyes are also on Glencore, which up till now has been prevented from making a renewed approach to Bunge because of a standstill agreement.Could this turn into an auction for Bunge For a company that is known for its aggressive and prolific dealmaking, Glencore is notable for almost never making a hostile takeover offer. Its worth remembering, too, that Glencore saw off interest from ADM to acquire Canadian grain handler Viterra Inc. in 2012.What price a deal Bunge shares jumped 11 percent on Jan. 19 after ADMs interest was first reported, giving it a market value of 10.9 billion for comparison, Chicagobased ADMs market capitalization is 22.9 billion. They were up 3.1 percent at 79.99 at 11:11 a.m. in New York.While Bunges stock has yet to revisit the highs seen last year, there may be limited upside. Glencore bought Viterra for 10.1 times the Canadian companys Ebitda, while Bunge is currently valued at 13.1 times earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bunge could fetch anywhere from 90 to 100 a share, analysts from Citigroup, Credit Suisse Group and the Vertical Group said in reports Monday. Antitrust challenges: If an ADMBunge tieup were to happen, regulators are likely to take a close look at the combined companys market share, especially in its domestic market.There could be criticism from farmers, just like there has been with another agricultural megamerger, Bayers acquisition of Monsanto. Department of Justice lawyers have sought out farmers who are opposed to that deal.Bloombergs Javier Blas contributed.Inside Amazon Go: The camerafilled convenience store that watches you back Bank of America ends free checking option, causing customer uproar Winnetka trader pleads guilty in commodities scheme that lost 13.8 million Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Glencore International AG

13 Pritzker’s African-American problem, and a whole lotta &amp;apos;glove&amp;apos; - Chicago Tribune Just how much will J.B. Pritzkers footinmouth problem with AfricanAmerican politicians cost himUnderstand this: It will cost him, and though hes relatively new to politics, he is a billionaire, so hell have to pay mightily for his Chicago political education.He made disparaging, patronizing comments about AfricanAmerican politicians on an FBI tape and now hes being beaten up for it.One of the more entertaining beatings has Pritzker mocked as oneeyed Jack by prominent South Side Democrat Emil Jones , which is a line from a great Marlon Brando movie.So dont tell me Pritzker wont pay, because he will, if he wants to stop the beating. And please dont tell me that Pritzkers ally, Mayor Rahm Emanuel , isnt trying to avoid this issue, hoping that reporters dont ask him about it.The mayor would rather talk about anything else  scholarships to City Colleges for public high school students, even his wife Amys horridtasting healthy shakes, which contain beets.But Emanuel doesnt want to talk about what Pritzker said about black politicians.Chicagos first black mayor, the late Mayor Harold Washington, loved to say that politics aint beanbag. In keeping with Washingtons realistic views on politics, here are three facts about Pritzkers dilemma you should know:1 Beanbags arent free.2 Without black voters, there is no Democratic Party in Illinois, and no chance for Pritzker to win the nomination for governor.3 Pritzkers Democratic primary opponent, Chris Kennedy, is using the controversy to make a hard play for AfricanAmerican votes. If hes successful, then Emanuels 2019 reelection chances may be in serious peril.If you think politics is about something other than who gets what, and how much, then you might just want to pick up a mandolin, sing a song and take another hit off the Hopium pipe.Robert Starks doesnt smoke Hopium. A longtime community organizer and professor of political science, Starks was with Harold Washington from the beginning.Hes listed as a solid Kennedy supporter in news reports, but Starks says that hes only leaning Kennedys way.J.B. Pritzker apologizes Feb. 6, 2018, about comments he made on a taped phone conversation with thenGov. Rod Blagojevich. John Byrne  Chicago TribuneJ.B. Pritzker apologizes Feb. 6, 2018, about comments he made on a taped phone conversation with thenGov. Rod Blagojevich. John Byrne  Chicago TribuneSEE MORE VIDEOS This controversy has given Kennedy an opening, said Starks. Now well see if Kennedy really steps up on the political and policy fronts. If Kennedy wins the primary, hell do so with AfricanAmerican votes, and that will be seen as an open threat to Mayor Emanuel, who is hoping things stay pretty much the way they are.So, with this much at stake, Pritzker will pay. All were talking about now is the price. And the price has gone up.It skyrocketed a few days ago when the Tribune broke the news that Pritzker was on that FBI tape with nowimprisoned Gov. Rod Blagojevich, talking disparagingly about black politicians filling the U.S. Senate vacancy created when Barack Obama was elected president.Pritzker put both feet up in there, chomped on them and swallowed hard in that Nov. 14, 2008, talk with the crooked governor, which was first reported by the Tribune earlier this week. A taped conversation between Pritzker and Blago revealed by the Tribune in June became the basis of an ad campaign by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner.Pritzker told Blago that appointing Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White to fill the Obama vacancy would cover you on the AfricanAmerican thing.Pritzker dismissed Emil Jones  Obamas political godfather  as too crass. He said Jesse Jackson Jr. was a nightmare and joined Blago in mocking Obamas former pastor, the incendiary Rev. Jeremiah Wright .Was this racism or politics I dont think it was overt racism. I think it was Democratic politics  two white Democrats discussing AfricanAmerican pawns on their game board.But then, Im not running for governor.Jones is a master politician and Kennedy supporter. He turned on this like a cat on a fat rabbit.He mocked Pritzker, saying he curried favor with Blago by offering up safe black candidates for the Senate.Hes a oneeyed Jack, said Jones. He runs around and says one thing, but the wiretap shows you a different person. It shows you the other side of his face and the other side of his face is what he is.In the superb 1961 Western OneEyed Jacks, Brando who also directed faces his betrayer, the villain Dad Longworth, played by Karl Malden:Youre a oneeyed Jack around this town, Dad, but Ive just seen the other side of your face.Boom.Pritzker found AfricanAmerican politicians whove endorsed him. He stood next to them for comfort and said he was sorry. They didnt look happy about standing there. They looked pained, as if theyd just undergone an awkward medical procedure.On Wednesday, he had Cook County Board President Toni Taxwinkle endorse him.Pritzker hasnt wept publicly yet, but if he needs to, he will.In the meantime, his surrogates will use rhetoric and euphemism to explain his moves. Theyll say hes reaching out to the black community, that hes seeking to connect with the community and make amends for his sins.What it all means is that Pritzker cannot take the AfricanAmerican vote for granted. And hell have to make arrangements with black political leaders on funding their campaigns and supporting their causes.This is how politics works.J.B.s running around town, calling people, apologizing, and people are saying he needs to show the community some love, a prominent AfricanAmerican politician told me Wednesday.But love isnt enough. J.Bs got to show us some glove, the politico said.Glove I asked. Glove, gloveYeah, glove, he laughed. Thats love with a g on it. You understandYes, I do.And you spell glove this way: .Listen to The Chicago Way podcast with John Kass and Jeff Carlin at http:wgnradio.comcategorywgnplusthechicagoway .jskass@chicagotribune.comTwitter @John_KassRELATED: Preckwinkle backs Pritzker, day after he apologized for remarks on AfricanAmerican politicians Pritzker apologizes for remarks on AfricanAmerican politicians, as rivals say hes now unelectable New PritzkerBlagojevich audio from FBI wiretaps sheds light on race issue in governor contest Letter: Why J.B.

14 Man arrested after breaching security at Illinois airport Man arrested after breaching security at Illinois airport 21818 11:17 AM PEORIA, Ill.  Several weekend flights were delayed or canceled at an Illinois airport after a man tried to use a stolen vehicle to ram the main terminal and breached security. The Gen. Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport in central Illinois says in a news release that the man was taken into custody and to a hospital after the incident early Saturday. The airport was closed for a few hours. Airport officials say the man used the car to try to ram the building but was unsuccessful. He then forced his way inside and spent several minutes in a secured area before trying to break into a police vehicle. The mans condition wasnt immediately clear, nor whether he had been charged. The Associated Press couldnt reach Peoria County sheriffs officials Sunday. Authorities believe the incident was isolated. TAGS

That upset the couples four adult children, who then hired their own team of investigators and a pathologist, who conducted second autopsies on the Shermans.The family said in a statement Friday that the new conclusion was expressed by the family from the outset and is consistent with the findings of the independent autopsy and investigation.The family continues to support the Toronto Police Service in their efforts to seek justice for their parents and pursue those responsible for these unspeakable crimes, the statement addedPolice have released the home back to the family. Gomes noted their frustration with police.For them its been difficult to balance their patience with their frustration with us and our investigation  not unlike any other family who have suffered such a sudden and profound loss, Gomes said. They have been understanding, cooperative and hopeful that this investigation can give them some answers.Toronto police investigators have scoured the 12,000squarefoot home, hauled away the couples cars and even checked the sewers in one of Torontos most exclusive neighborhoods for clues. Police have taken 125 witness statements and analyzed surveillance video in the neighborhood.Sherman, 75, was known for litigiousness and aggressive businesses practices as he developed Apotex Inc., which has a global workforce of about 11,000.In Prescription Games, a 2001 book about the industry, he mused that a rival might want to kill him.Amy B Wang and Cleve R.

The thought once came to my mind, why didnt they just hire someone to knock me off For a thousand bucks paid to the right person you can probably get someone killed. Perhaps Im surprised that hasnt happened.Canadian Business magazine recently estimated his worth at 4.77 billion Canadian dollars 3.65 billion, making him the 15th richest person in the country.As they became wealthy, the couple became known for philanthropy. They gave tens of millions to the United Jewish Appeal, donated to a geriatric hospital in Toronto and sent medicine to disaster zones. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attended the funeral and Sherman is posthumously due to receive one of the countrys highest civilian honors this year.Friends and family say the couple had been making plans for the future.

24 Michelle Obama Presents 2018 Counselor of the Year Award to Chicago Educator - High School &amp; Beyond - Education Week Michelle Obama Presents 2018 Counselor of the Year Award to Chicago Educator By Rachel Wegner on February 5, 2018 1:29 PM  No comments Kirsten Perry has heard her share of painful stories of loss, hardship, and misfortune as a public school counselor on the west side of Chicago. But she is even more deeply moved by the resilience of her students and the families and vibrance of the community around them. On Friday, Perry received the national 2018 School Counselor of the Year award during a celebration at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. The American School Counselor Association ASCA also honored one school counselor from each state, along with Perry. The awardees gathered on stage as former first lady Michelle Obama presented the national award, giving her first televised speech since her time in the White House. We know where the real work of changing kids lives happens, Obama said. It happens on the ground, in classrooms, and communities, and in those facetoface, hearttoheart interactions between our kids and caring educators and counselors, like the folks on this stage. Days later, Perry said she was still in shock at meeting the former first lady. Im still processing the whole thing, she said with a laugh. Like, did that really happen Obama revisited her promise to continue the work she started with the Reach Higher Initiative, which encourages students to pursue education beyond high school. She was joined by several celebrities and leaders at the celebration, including ASCA Executive Director Richard Wong, reality cooking show host Ted Allen, Reach Higher Executive Director Eric Waldo and former U.S. Secretary of Education John B. King. Reflecting on anxious times for the nation, Obama encouraged those gathered to remain hopeful. You all have the power to teach our kids what it means to go high when others go low, Obama said. She introduced Perry as a perfect example of that work. After Perry began working at Lawndale Community Academy in 2015, the PreK8 school rose to level two academic standing among Chicagos public schools. The school was at level three, the lowest in the district, for the five years preceding that. Lawndale has also seen a 61 percent drop in chronic absenteeism since Perry began. She has launched numerous initiatives and programs, including everything from a running club to gathering students in peace circles. Peace circles are a place where students in conflict gather, discuss their issues, and work together toward a peaceful solution. Perry said it is part of a restorative justice approach to addressing student beavhior she is working to implement. She explained in an interview that past approaches have been more punitive, punishing behaviors with suspensions and other disciplinary actions. Restorative justice is more about building community, getting to the root cause of a students behavior, and working through the lens of providing support, Perry said. She said that Lawndale still has much to learn when it comes to restorative justice, but that the school is seeing some success as staff members work toward the new system. At times, Perry said teachers and parents are involved in the peace circles or resolution efforts. Two students also spoke at the event about the personal impact Perry made on their lives. Student Kyla Evans said Perry helped her control her anger and encouraged her to stop skipping school. And even though Evans is now enrolled as a 9th grader at another school, she still comes to visit Perry. I know she will keep pushing me to go to school, believe in myself, and think about my future, Evans said. Miss Perry shows every day that she cares about all the kids at Lawndale. Perry said crime, poverty, and the lingering effects of systemic racism facing Lawndale create challenges from day to day. But she also said she finds joy in watching her students transform and witnessing a strong, vibrant community fight for a better future. Ive only been working in Lawndale twoandahalf years, Perry said. I feel like Im getting too much credit compared to some people who are so deepy invested in the community. Theyve been working and fighting this battle for decades. In her acceptance speech, Perry said school counselors are advocates, collaborators, and systemic change agents who can be a voice for the the voiceless. She hopes her students also find their own voices along the way.

25 IU basketball flunks road test at Illinois CHAMPAIGN, Ill.  An ugly second half doomed to an avoidable defeat Wednesday night at Illinois, the Hoosiers falling 7371. Coach Archie Millers team struggled to deal with the highpressure defense the Illini applied, and to hit free throws consistently. Those mistakes handed Illinois its first Big Ten win, and brought IU 129, 54 back to earth after .had 28 points and eight rebounds, and Zach McRoberts had 10 points, all in the first half.Here are Three Reasons Why the Hoosiers couldnt take their success on the road:Costly free throws Indiana was hardly the countrys best freethrow shooting outfit entering Wednesday. The Hoosiers season mark of 66.7 percent before their trip to Illinois was a bottom50 number nationally.Yet somehow it managed to sink further, cheap points being tossed away for an offense that can hardly afford to waste them.IU started an abysmal 4of12 from the freethrow line, a number that played a key role in Illinois hanging around. The Hoosiers finished just 16of29 from the line, a damaging number on the road.Foul disparity If freethrow shooting was a known problem coming in, foul issues were not a problem.In Big Ten play alone, the Hoosiers were fourth in the league in opponent freethrow rate. They typically do well keeping opponents away from the line.Illinois 1111, 18 proved an exception to the rule, especially in the second half. The Illini got into the bonus with more than 13 minutes remaining, and wound up with 30 freethrow attempts in the second half.The Hoosiers own problems getting free throws to go down were only made more glaring by Illinois performance. The hosts shot 23of32 on free throws Wednesday evening.Missed free throws kept IU from building a more comfortable and probably deserved lead at halftime. Giving Illinois too many doomed the Hoosiers after the break.Senioritis Senior guards and Josh Newkirk have been part of the solution during IUs strong start to Big Ten play. They were part of the problem Wednesday night.Together, the pair combined for 10 points, three assists and seven turnovers, as subdued of a performance as theyve had together in some time.Newkirk struggled to perform against Illinois pressure. Miller opted to give Devonte Green a share of his minutes.Johnson couldnt seem to find a rhythm on the offensive end, turning in perhaps his quietest game since going scoreless at Louisville on Dec. 9. He hit a couple of timely 3pointers in the first half but managed only a marginal impact in the second, often struggling to get the ball in his hands and beat Illinois perimeter defense.Miller is fond of saying his team is always best when his backcourt is working well. Its leaders couldnt keep the pace Wednesday night.Follow IndyStar reporter Zach Osterman on Twitter: @ZachOsterman.CLOSE The Indiana Hoosiers gritty win over Maryland suggests improvement, especially in response to Michigan State.

29 Illinois Bill Aims To End Youth Tackle Football http:ift.tt2nbLdny A new plan in Illinois aims to end youth tackle football programs with the goal of preventing Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy CTE, a degenerative disease of the brain caused by repetitive brain trauma. The bill bears the name of Dave Duerson, a 1985 Chicago Bear who killed himself. Doing so by shooting himself in the chest in order to preserve his brain for research. Tregg Duerson, Daves son, says he hopes sharing his fathers story will give the bill necessary momentum. When I look at my fathers action of donating his brain in the very last moments of his life, that was someone who was trying to be helpful and trying to be part of the solution to the greater problem of concussions and brain trauma.Research proved Duerson did suffer from CTE. Something Tregg says he recognizes now in hindsight.He showed that he was forgetful and confused and disoriented. I can also point to times when he was just overwhelmed with anger and depression, says Tregg. When I think about my father and all he experienced, I really look at the suicide note that he left me and my family. In that note he described his troubles with memory, blurred vision, writing and spelling, as well as the pain he felt in his head. State Representative Carol Sente, a Democrat from Vernon Hills is sponsoring the bill. In a press release , Sente says research and data prove the risks of playing tackle football arent worth it. I am confident we have the science on our side and can make a very persuasive argument that safer football for youth will lead to healthier and more rewarding lives for generations to come.Illinois has made improvements in concussion protocols, including a 2015 law requiring athletic programs to develop concussion response procedures. Although some suggest smaller schools or programs with limited resources may be at a disadvantage. A recent study found CTE in 110 out of 111 deceased NFL players whose brains were analyzed.If approved Illinois would be the first state to ban youth tackle football. 09ILSN,15Health,19Legal,30Bapo,E Sente,RK ClientFeedsvia Podcast  NPR Illinois  91.9 UIS http:nprillinois.org January 25, 2018 at 04:20PM

38 Chicago anti-gang cops may have robbed drug dealers: report close Video Chicago gang members say more police wont cure citys ills Mike Tobin reportsMultiple members of a Chicago Police Department antigang unit have been stripped of their authority following a federal probe into allegations that they robbed drug dealers.The decision to suspend the police powers of a sergeant and several officers  who were on the departments Area Central antigang team  came after nearly a yearlong probe by the FBI and Chicago police Internal Affairs Division, the Chicago Tribune reported.Authorities raided at least two of the officers homes Tuesday. Although no arrests were made, criminal charges were expected to be filed.The investigation started after an informant told federal authorities that he had been robbed by members of police antigang unit. Authorities reportedly set up a sting operation to catch the officers on undercover video.The unnamed 45yearold sergeant has been working in the department since 1996 and has seen 23 complaints filed against him during his 21 years on the force, including alleged illegal arrests, civil rights violations and improper use of a weapon, the Tribune reported.The sergeant has also been named in four federal lawsuits since 2001, including a still open case regarding a fatal 2014 police shooting of an allegedly suicidal man who attacked the officers with a knife.The latest scandal is another setback to the Chicago Police Department still reeling from the shooting of 17yearold Laquan McDonald and other scandals such as officers allegedly stealing cash and drugs from drug dealers. The Obama Justice Department indicted the department in January 2016 and accused the police officers of being poorly trained, undisciplined, and inadequately supervised.In a bid to avoid federal government intrusion, however, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel worked with U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions Justice Department to come up with an agreement that avoids federal oversight on police reforms.A spokesman for the police said integrity and accountability are paramount to the force but did not comment on the probe until or unless criminal charges are filed.Lukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

40 NISSAN 370Zki BRINGS NEW MEANING TO ‘WINTER SPORTS’ AT THE 2018 CHICAGO AUTO SHOW Nissan is getting into the winter sports spirit this month with a specially constructed, oneoff 370Z Roadster snowmobile. Dubbed the 370Zki  pronounced 370Ski  the 332horsepower 370Z Roadster is ready to tackle ski slopes and backwoods trails alike with its front skis and rear snow tracks replacing the iconic sports cars usual high performance tires. The Nissan 370Zki makes its world debut this week at the 2018 Chicago Auto Show. Nissan 370Zki The Nissan 370Zki continues our recent tradition of bringing imaginative winter vehicle concepts to the Chicago Auto Show. With the Nissan Zs long heritage of motorsports competition, the 370Zki seemed like a natural combination, said Michael Bunce, vice president, Product Planning, Nissan North America, Inc. Prior to its debut here in Chicago, we put the 370Zki through its paces on the slopes in Wyoming where its performance heritage really came through.Transforming the factory stock 370Z Roadster to the snow trackcarving 370Zki presented a few understandable obstacles. To make room for the rear DOMINATOR  Tracks from American Track Truck, Inc ., the entire drivetrain was first removed from the 370Z Roadster. Then a custom lift kit was designed and engineered, lifting the vehicle three inches from the normal height. Next came fabrication of custom mountings for the rear suspension springs and threeinch custom spacers to mount the snow tracks to the wheel hubs. The factory brakes were retained but the brake lines had to be rerouted and the exhaust system was modified to fit under the vehicle. The rear wheel wells were also modified for clearance of the fourfootlong snow tracks.In front, the suspension was modified to accommodate the new ride height, and adaptors were made to allow the appropriate travel and rotation for the front skis  which were also supplied by American Track Truck, Inc.  and mounted with spacers to the stock wheel hubs. The engine and transmission also had to be custommounted and a front skid plate fabricated to prevent damage during snow excursions.By comparison, the cosmetic part of the conversion was relatively easy. The custom body wrap was created and applied by Icon Image Graphics and the headlights were tinted yellow to resemble ski goggles.Nissans full range of winter adventureready vehicles will be on display throughout the Chicago Auto Show, from our bestselling Rogue AWD to the powerful TITAN 4x4 and TITAN XD 4x4 lineups, said Bunce. Its also fun to shake things up with something totally unexpected once in a while  and thats the Nissan 370Zki.Nissan 370Zki Project Build Specifications Base Vehicle:              Nissan 370Z RoadsterDrivetrain:                    332horsepower 3.7liter DOHC V6, 7speed automatic transmission, rearwheel driveTop:                                   Cloth powerfolding roof with fabric inner linerModifications: Partsystem Suppliermodification DOMINATOR  TracksAmerican Track Truck, Inc.Width 15 inchesLength 48 inchesHeight 30 inchesFront skisAmerican Track Truck, Inc.Width 12 inchesLength 56 inchesWheel wellsOpened up front and rearWheel spacers3inch front and rearSuspensionCustom mounting fabrication frontand rearBrakesFactory spec front and rear,relocated  including brake linesSteeringFactory specEngineFactory spec 3.7liter V6, 332 hp,270 lbft torqueBody wrapIcon Image GraphicsThe Nissan 370Zki will be on public display at the 2018 Chicago Auto Show, which runs Feb. 1019 at Chicagos McCormick Place.

43 Simple Tips For Body Piercing In Chicago IL By Pamela Snyder The decision to get a piercing should never be taken lightly, because the risk of infection, scarring and major corrective surgery is extremely high. Research, comparisons and reviews can help you find the best quality services, but preparation to help your new physical modification along, will protect against the loss of your stud, earring or enhancement. Tips for body piercing in Chicago IL can protect your health and provide lasting aesthetics.Every area of the body may be pierced whether a traditional earring to eyebrow rings, nose studs and genitalia. The procedure is not as simple as picking the first artist you come across and hoping for the best, but to invest in research and to speak to professionals to ensure they are familiar with what you are looking for. When things do not work out the way as planned, you could be facing the expenses of hospital bills for infections and will lose the piercings.Unfortunately not all body pierce artists offer an equal standard of service and without investigation into practices you may pay the price. Professionals must have experience, skill and knowledge of the procedure to minimize excessive bleeding, scarring and an inability to keep the area pierced. Regardless of personal reasons for piercings, a high standard of hygiene practices and care must be taken to protect your wellbeing.Any medical problems must be discussed with a practitioner before getting the body modification performed. Factors including hypertension and diabetes should be expressed to minimize illness during the procedure and to alert the professional of steps they must take to monitor your health during the placement. There is greater risk of infections for those who possess a compromised immune system.Practicality is an important part of choosing piercings to ensure you can maintain it, will be satisfied with it long term and it does not interfere with personal and professional activities. Constantly fidgeting over an item of jewelry can cause an infection to form and prevents the area from healing. Assess your professional needs and whether a visible addition may compromise work related opportunities.An experienced practitioner must provide detailed maintenance practices to best manage your healthcare and enhancement needs. Many types of modifications are available and requires a clear assessment of each before proceeding with a final selection. Experienced artists will deliver complete instructions on the maintenance of these pieces and deliver the most beneficial solutions for your healthcare and aesthetic needs.Research into the practices and procedures of a select artist is an imperative part of the process. Look at previous work completed, assess customer reviews and consult with the artist to listen to their practices and suggestions. The facility where the piercing is to be performed must be clean, well organized and incorporate personal interests into the design.High quality procedures and steps will provide the most effective solutions for your needs and minimize the risk associated with poor practice. Significant enhancement practices delivered by professional and experienced artists can help you achieve appealing results and prevent complications.

46 Chicago condo owners: New law erodes privacy - Residential News - Crain&#39;s Chicago Business Photo by Getty ImagesiStockphoto Condo owners: New law erodes privacy Two Chicago aldermen want to give condo boards in the city the power to ignore a piece of Illinois condo law that some homeowners consider a threat to their privacy. The state rule, which went into effect Jan. 1, requires a condo association to provide a list of contact informationincluding mailing address, phone number and email addresson all unit owners to any owner who requests it. The rule is intended to provide transparency, said state Rep. Andre Thapedi, the chief sponsor of HB 189. His district runs from Park Manor on the citys South Side west to suburban Hickory Hills. Owners should be able to communicate with each other, Thapedi said in an email to Crains. The bill, he said, puts the same information into the hands of unit owners that the condo board and the management company, if there is one, already have access to. Does it make sense that joint owners should only be able to communicate with each other through management companies and lawyers Thapedi asked. Last spring, Thapedis HB 189 passed both houses of the General Assembly with nearunanimous votes. Gov. Bruce Rauner signed it into law in August. After it went into effect at the dawn of 2018, I got hundreds of calls, letters and emails from condo owners who object to that information being given out, said Ald. Brian Hopkins, 2nd, who along with Ald. Brendan Reilly, 42nd, proposed a city ordinance Jan. 17 that essentially makes the rule optional. Reilly and Hopkins represent wards that are among the densest with condos. Their ordinance would prohibit the release of unit owners contact information unless at least twothirds of unit owners have voted to adopt the state rule. That is, condo boards in the city would be exempt from the state rule unless they opt in. Hopkins said numerous residents told him the state rule is intrusive. People dont want their personal contact information given out. Reilly said in an emailed statement that he expects the ordinance to be discussed at the February meeting of the City Councils Committee on Housing  Real Estate. Reilly said that decisions regarding unit owners privacy should be handled with the most local of local controls: a majority vote of the full homeowners association. This will allow each condominium building to have important conversations about balancing privacy with transparency. The state rule is pretty universally disliked by our homeowners, said Judy Ziner, vice president for operations in the Chicago office of Liberman Management Services, which manages 12,000 condo units in the city and a total of 45,000 in the Chicago area. A lot of people use only a cellphone because they dont want uninvited phone calls, Ziner said. And they dont want a lot of email cluttering their inbox. Surface mail, she said, should be sufficient for communicating associationrelated matters, and many large condos have online bulletin boards or forums where owners can communicate about issues facing the condo board. Since the new rule went into effect, some condo owners have withdrawn their email and phone information from the management companies files, Ziner said. That could prove problematic in the event of an emergency when the management company needs to reach unit owners quickly. Theres value in sharing limited contact information among owners, Reillys statement said, but the new state law simply goes too far. Thapedi said that sharing owners contact information is a step toward more open communication among owners. When a condo board is entertaining offers from developers for a bulk buy of all the units in the building for deconversion to rentals, for example, keep in mind, were talking about a group of people who own something together, Thapedi said, but theyre prevented from communicating their desires to their fellow owners. While most condo owners, and particularly those who dont live in the building full time, want the management company to have their phone and email information in case of an emergency, Hopkins said, they dont want that information given out to everyone who aspires to run for a seat on the condo board, or who has a grievance about something the board did. The politics in a condo building, Hopkins said, can get intense, and some people dont want to be contacted about it. The rule includes a requirement that a unit owner promise not to use the list for commercial purposes, but its too vague, both Ziner and Hopkins said. People who request the list should be required to state their precise intention with the information, Hopkins said. The aldermens proposed ordinance invokes home rule, the power of a municipality to go its own way on a matter that the state legislates. Hopkins said this was necessary because the state rule snuck in under the radar. It was not something people were aware of until after the law passed, so were responding retroactively. Thapedi countered that its unfortunate that certain aldermen want to abrogate the letter and spirit of state regulation of condominium ownership.

Mays elementary school in the Englewood neighborhood Chicago. Five years after the nations largest mas... By SOPHIA TAREEN and DON BABWINAssociated Press CHICAGO AP  Five years after the largest mass closure of public schools in an American city, Chicago is forging ahead with a plan to shutter four more in one of the citys highestcrime and most impoverished areas. School officials are pitching the new closures around Englewood, a neighborhood on Chicagos South Side, to make way for a new 85 million school they insist will better serve students and reverse low enrollment. But some parents, students and activists are skeptical, saying theyre still reeling from the 2013 closures and the latest plan will make things worse, including the displacement of hundreds of mostly black and poor teenagers. The last thing they should do is close our schools, said 16yearold Miracle Boyd, a student at John Hope College Prep, which could close. They arent the ones sitting in those chairs five days a week struggling to learn because we dont have the necessities we need as students. ... Why not use the 85 million to improve our education and get our schools on the road to success Like other cities, Chicago has long relied on closures to address underperforming and underutilized schools. Significant closures have taken place in Philadelphia, Detroit and St. Louis, but Chicago made history when it closed roughly 50 schools, affecting more than 12,000 students in mostly AfricanAmerican and Latino neighborhoods. The debate over Chicagos latest proposed closures has exploded, with shouting matches and emotional pleas during community meetings. Residents have pleaded with the district to invest more in neighborhood schools and safety. Some have alleged that racial politics are at play. And they worry by pulling students out of schools near their homes and placing them in ones farther away, they are putting them in danger of gang members who will view them as the enemy just by virtue of their address. Chicago Public Schools says nothing is final until an expected Feb. 28 board vote. The nations thirdlargest school district argues its tried to boost enrollment and resources to the four schools, but it hasnt helped. The changes coincide with a major drop in black residents. Roughly 180,000 people moved from Chicago from 2000 to 2010, according to census data. In Englewood, about 10 miles from downtown, fewer than 500 students are enrolled in the four schools. As a result, one freshmen class has only 17 students and another school doesnt offer science. We have to move these kids. They dont have enough support in these buildings, schools chief Janice Jackson said. We cant sit by and continue to watch people leave. The new school, which would open in 2019, will enroll only freshmen at the beginning, and upperclassmen will be left to attend nearby schools. The district expects to spend millions on the transition, including on individualized plans to help students at risk of dropping out, paid summer job programs and possible shuttle buses to transport students. Research on the benefits of school closures is mixed. In 2017, the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado Boulder compiled research finding that even when students transferred to higherperforming schools, those students saw an achievement drop in the first year and marginal gains later on. Theres no ground to stand on for saying this will improve the educational opportunities, said Pauline Lipman, a University of Illinois at Chicago professor who has studied closures. Chicago Public Schools officials disagree. With past closures, theyve emphasized cost savings. This time, theyve pitched the proposal as a more desirable option for students. Renderings of the new school tout outdoor sports facilities and a community health center. City officials say it complements other recent investment in Englewood, including a new lowercost Whole Foods. But critics, including neighborhood activists and unions, say the district didnt do enough to address problems it helped create and theres a lack of trust, especially after two consecutive CPS leaders left office under scandal. The Chicago Teachers Union blames the citys push for charter schools. Roughly 90 percent of Englewoods students travel beyond neighborhood boundaries for school. Experts say property values will drop, vacant buildings are magnets for street crime and sending students to new schools could put their lives at risk. What people dont understand is that if you are 16 years old and get on a bus, when you get off that bus you are gangaffiliated whether you are gangaffiliated or not, said activist Jitu Brown. Tensions between students from different Chicago neighborhoods attending the same school have erupted in violence before. In 2009, 16yearold honor student Derrion Albert was fatally beaten after getting caught in the middle of such a clash. The attack involving students from Fenger High School on Chicagos South Side was captured on cellphone video that was viewed online worldwide. In Englewood, crime is still high despite a significant drop in homicides and shootings there last year. The violence that remains is startling considering the dwindling population. Demographers say Englewoods population decreased from 59,000 residents in 1980 to 26,000 by 2015. In 2016, there were 86 homicides in Englewood, up from 37 the year before. The Chicago district has had trouble selling and repurposing buildings since 2013 and had to loosen guidelines for potential buyers. There are now about 27 schools on that list, but more than a dozen remain empty, including several in Englewood. Among them is Yale Elementary School, which singing and acting star Jennifer Hudson attended. The eerily quiet brick building sits near boardedup homes and empty lots. Letters on the school sign have fallen off. Under the new proposal, one school would remain vacant, two would be taken over by existing charter schools and one would be demolished for the new school. Not everyone opposes the districts plan. It would be a catalyst for new growth in the area. It gives us something that we can build on, here in Englewood, said Theodria Constanoplis, 74. She has lived in Englewood most of her life, and one of her grandchildren could attend the new school. Still, some educators remain skeptical, saying the closures mark the end of an era. Harper High School theater teacher Michael Buino said his students can compete with those who attend schools considered to be Chicagos best. Michelle Obama, who is from Chicago, visited Harper High in 2013 while still first lady. Come to my classroom and see for yourselves, Buino said at a recent community forum. And then tell me Harper is not worth saving. ___ Follow Sophia Tareen on Twitter at https:twitter.comsophiatareen .  
49 Hyundai Drops 2018 Sonata Hybrids In Chicago Hyundai just showed off the soontobeinastore near you 2018 Sonata Hybrids, both standard and plugin, at the Chicago Auto Show. Hyundai seems to roll out new models or improvements and updates to models every two weeks. How Hyundai does this is beyond me, but Im just glad theyre able to keep it up. As I said, we now have two Sonatas to look at, the Hybrid and Plugin Hybrid.Of course, the new Sonatas come with a comprehensive exterior and interior redesign along with more safety stuff, better suspension, improved infotainment, and connectivity features, but the real star of the show is the gaselectric drivetrainsSonata Hybrid The center of the 2018 Sonata Hybrid is a 2.0liter Nu GDI fourcylinder engine mated to a sixspeed automatic transmission. Situated within the transmission is a 38 kW electric motor and clutch where the torque converter should be. Hyundais clever idea of putting the hybrid drive guts within the transmission  something they call a TransmissionMounted Electrical Device TMED  works the same as any other hybrid, but with improved fuel economy via a larger electric motor. Plus, youve got to say thats pretty smart packaging.The traditional ICE part of the hybrid system produces 154 horsepower and 140 lbft. of torque. Add in the electric motor and you get a further 38 kW 51 horsepower and another 151 lbft. of torque. Net power comes up at 193 horsepower at 6,000 rpm. Economywise, with a Sonata Hybrid SE youll get 39 mpg in the city, 45 on the highway, and a combined figure of 42. If you add that all up, you can go for around 650 miles under typical driving conditions. ChoiceThe lithiumion polymer battery pack capacity is good for 1.76 kWh and the whole shebang fits under the trunk floor. Ergo, lots of trunk space, a flat trunk floor, and 6040 splitfolding rear seats. Total cargo volume for the Sonata Hybrid is 13.3 cubic feet.Sonata Plugin Hybrid The Plugin Hybrid is similar to the regular Sonata Hybrid, but with the benefit of extended allelectric travel. Theres a 9.8 kWh lithiumion polymer battery pack which is more than five times larger than the Sonata Hybrids battery. According to the EPA, the Sonata Plugin Hybrid has an allelectric range of 27 miles, and it can be recharged in less than three hours with a leveltwo charger. Which, if you think about this, allows you to commute to work, park the thing, plug it in for a recharge, and then drive it home without burning a drop of gas. And hey, if youve got to head out of town for a long weekend, youve got plenty of range thanks to the gasoline engine. Total estimated range is a remarkable 590 miles.The Plugin Hybrid has the same sixspeed automatic with Hyundais TMED in place of the torque converter again, only this time the electric motor is a 50 kW beast. That 50 kW electric motor puts out 32 percent more power versus the Sonata Hybrid. The plugin hybrid uses the same ICE as the Sonata Hybrid, and the total system output is 202 horsepower at 6,000 rpm. To compliment the performance, the chassis gets some nips and tucks with a stiffer front antiroll bar and a more rigid rear trailingarm design with retuned bushings.Notable Features Other highlights for the 2018 Sonatas include a new frontrear fascia design, a new grille, hood, front fenders, rear deck lid, headlights, and taillights. There are new 16inch and 17inch ecospoke wheel designs, along with new LED headlights that have a trick cornering Dynamic Bending Light DBL function. The interior has a new instrument panel, center stack, steering wheel, wireless phone charging, and rear USB charge port.Safety gadgets By the ton. Theres standard BlindSpot Detection, Rear CrossTraffic Alert, Lane Change Assist, a newly available Automatic Emergency Braking system, and Lane Keep Assist.Manufacturing  Availability The 2018 Sonata Hybrids will be produced in Asan, Korea. The Hybrid will be in Hyundai dealers by the first quarter of 2018 and Plugins will show up in the second quarter.Tony Borroz has spent his entire life racing antique and sports cars. He is the author of Bricks  Bones: The Endearing Legacy and NittyGritty Phenomenon of The Indy 500, available in paperback or Kindle format . 2018 Sonata Hybrid Gallery Photos  Source: Hyundai Motor America.

53 Chicago 2019 Mayoral Elections Chicago 2019 Mayoral Elections Don Rose 23 January 2018 One Comment Lets take a shutdown breather to check out the eternal question, will Rahm Emanuel be reelected mayor Though the city election is only a year away, a prospective scenario is shaping up. Emanuel is almost certain to run. Hes out there regularly announcing new programsand, as usual, announcing their immediate success. Hes pushing hard to land the jobsrich Amazon headquarters and the recently announced Apple campus. Chicago is one of Amazons20 finalist cities. Hes working especially hard in the African American communities where he is considered vulnerable because of his presumed role in the coverup of the killing of Laquan McDonald by a Chicago policeman. The video of the killing was withheld for close to a year, until after his 2015 election campaign when he was forced into a runoff against Jesus Chuy Garcia. Emanuel won the African American vote substantially thanks to an endorsement and commercials by thenPresident Barack Obama, but many wonder whether even Obamas magic can repair Emanuels negative image in black neighborhoods. Thus far there is only one declared candidate against him: Troy Anthony LaRiviere, the outspoken principal of a highly rated public school who was fired for his political activitiesnotably supporting and making social media videos for Garcia. LaRiviere, an African American, was immediately elected head of the principals association and, with Garcia, pushed hard for Bernie Sanders in 2016. This helped him immeasurably in the progressive community, making him the current favorite to unite blacks and white progressives now that Garcia has opted to run for congress and is the overwhelming favorite to replace Luis Gutierrez. On the horizon, though undeclared, are Garry McCarthy, the chief of police thrown under the bus by Emanuel in the wake of the McDonald disclosures, and Bridget Gainer, a smart, well regarded Cook County Commissioner, long itching for higher office. McCarthy was not especially popular among the citys copsthough he gets sympathy because the lessliked Emanuel doublecrossed him after publicly supporting him. McCarthy talked police reformbut it was mostly talk. He should have a strong base on the citys conservative northwest and southwest where cops and firefighters are clustered and the old Machines strongest leaders, who never really liked Emanuel, remain powerful. Gainer is the least known of the quartet, but is pushing herself forward more and more. Her northside district encompasses several of Emanuels strongest wards and is generally considered an Emanuel ally. Thus many wonder whether she will actually take him onbut if she does, and gains any traction, she could scoop thousands of votes from his base, especially among newly activated women. This lineup, chopping away conservative and uppermiddleclass white vote blocs from Emanuel makes LaRiviere a likely prospect for a runoff if he consolidates the African American voteand especially if Garcia and his allies line up substantial Latino support to reciprocate for his efforts in 2015. If there is Emanuel fatigue out there and McCarthy catches fire, the mayor could even wind up out of the running. On the other hand, if he lands either Amazon or Apple, he could win handily. Additions to or subtractions from the lineup may change the equation.  Don Rose is a regular columnist for the Chicago Daily Observer One Comment  Observant said: A possible preemptive strike has been fired against Cook County Commissioner Bridget Gainer. An article appeared in the SunTimes highlighting her absenteeism at the Cook County Board of Commissioners. According to the story, Gainer missed 32 of Board meetings and committee meetings  the most absences of any of the commissioners.  23 January 2018 at 10:26 pm Leave your response Add your comment below, or trackback from your own site.

57 Bulls hope Rising Stars Challenge is taste of what&amp;apos;s to come - Chicago Tribune The day after Lauri Markkanen almost made coach Fred Hoiberg pass out, the unflappable Bulls rookie acted as if nothing happened.He had a good spirit about him, Kris Dunn recalled. He didnt brag or act cocky. He just came back to work.Markkanen and Dunn enjoyed the fruits of their first and secondyear labors Friday night at Staples Center in Los Angeles, competing against each other as the World team defeated the U.S. group 155124 in the Rising Stars Challenge to kick off NBA AllStar weekend.Markkanen finished with 15 points and six rebounds in 22 minutes for the World team, while Dunn, in just his second game action since his nasty fall and concussion Jan. 17, had nine points, five assists and three steals in 19 minutes for the U.S.But perhaps the defining moment of their season came just more than a month earlier all the way on the other coast, at New Yorks Madison Square Garden on Jan. 10.Thats the night Markkanen dunked all over Enes Kanter and sank eight 3pointers en route to his seasonhigh 33 points. Thats also the night Dunn proved his perseverance and prowess at closing by sinking the goahead basket in double overtime despite missing 14 of his first 17 shots.And that was the night Hoiberg lightheartedly said Markkanens highlightreel dunk almost made him pass out.Im surprised with his athletic ability, Dunn said this week. You wouldnt think he could rise the way he can, but he has a lot of athletic ability. Hes a phenomenal shooter.But what makes him good is his confidence. I mean, to do what he did at Madison Square Garden, youre not going to find too many people who can do that being a rookie.Dunn actually was more impressed with what happened the next day.He was ready to move on to the next one, Dunn said. I think thats good about a player like Lauri  dont get too high, dont get too low. Of course youre going to look at the dunk a couple of times. Why wouldnt youMarkkanen, billed as a shooter, is more into dunks than one might think. As the morning shootaround wound down that day at Madison Square Garden, he asked the yettodebut Zach LaVine to attempt a throughthelegs baseline dunk that LaVine missed on his first try so Markkanen could film it on his phone.He takes pride in his athleticism.I dont think people were expecting that from me, Markkanen said.To hear some say it, expectations were even lower this season for Dunn, who didnt get a sniff of the Rising Stars Challenge last season despite the Timberwolves selecting him fifth overall. Even secondround pick Malcolm Brogdon, the eventual Rookie of the Year, snagged an invitation.There were plenty of armchair critics who already had labeled Dunn a bust after his underwhelming rookie season with the Timberwolves. Funny thing is, the president of basketball operations who traded him didnt fall in that category.I felt he was going to have a great year this year, Tom Thibodeau , also the Timberwolves coach, said.Thibodeau based this on the exit meeting he had with Dunn after last season and Dunns response to it, which basically was, in a decision that Thibodeau always chooses, to work harder.Kris is a very intelligent kid, Thibodeau said. Hes a tough kid, stubborn in a good way, and he was highly motivated.The defensive part of it, he had that coming in. The offensive part, he put a lot of work into it and has played very well.So well that Dunn has emerged as the Bulls best closer.He has that clutch gene, Hoiberg said.In the grand scheme of things, Friday night was a small cherry on the sundae. If the Bulls rebuild is going to take flight, Dunn, Markkanen and LaVine need to start earning berths in the grownup AllStar Game on Sunday.But Friday night also marked a measure of vindication for Dunn, which is why he took his family with him to enjoy AllStar weekend. And the night also continued a seemingly seamless rookie season for Markkanen, 20, who never seems fazed by anything even as his exploits, such as his dunk on Kanter in January, cause a stir.Hes a rock, Hoiberg said. His overall confidence has been very impressive. The way he can bounce back from a tough performance and perform at a high level the next game, thats not easy to do when youre a rookie and you cant buy a drink yet.He does so many little things, and hes a great teammate. On some other teams, you could have some animosity for a rookie to get the attention hes getting. But guys are genuinely happy for him.kcjohnson@chicagotribune.comTwitter @kcjhoop5 things to watch during the Bulls remaining 25 games The NBA must sever ties with Wynn hotels in wake of sexual harassment allegations Kris Dunn and Lauri Markkanen relish AllStar weekend together Ice dancer Gabriella Papadakis holds up despite wardrobe malfunction nightmare We need to know the names of those four racists ejected from the Blackhawks game Olympics winners and losers: NBC, Johnny Weir, Nathan Chen, Winnie the Pooh and more Privacy Policy Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Coaches Kris Dunn Basketball Fred Hoiberg Zach LaVine Tom Thibodeau Chicago Bulls
58 MLB owners hopeful of fixing pace of play without showdown - Chicago Arizona Diamondbacks owner Ken Kendrick is hoping Major League Baseball and the players association can work out a deal to improve pace of play without imposing changes on the union unilaterally.Commissioner Rob Manfred has long vowed to put new rules in place for the upcoming season with or without an agreement, but says his preference is for a deal and he is willing to negotiate the changes involving a pitch clock or limits on mound visits.We need to improve the pace of play and as the Commissioner said very well we need to really try to do it as partners with the players because that will make it work better than if Rob made a decision to do it on his own, Kendrick said Wednesday after the first of two days of owners meetings near Beverly Hills.MLB has the right to implement the proposal it made last offseason, which includes a 30second clock between batters and a 20second clock between pitches that would reset when a pitcher steps off the rubber and when he makes or feints a pickoff throw, according to details obtained by the AP.Nineinning games averaged a record 3 hours, 5 minutes during the 2017 regular season and 3:29 during the postseason. Players have resisted a pitch clock while appearing slightly more amenable to limits on mound visits.The absence of a clock is both a blessing and a curse, Kendrick said. Its more the pace of how the game flows and there are times when it doesnt flow well. Its our responsibility to the fans to try to help that. Theres a lot of interest within baseball and I think on the players side as well.Manfred is expected to address the issue when he speaks at the conclusion of the meetings Thursday.Kendrick met with some of his fellow owners to discuss the effect of the new tax laws on player trades and pending action in the Supreme Court over legalized gambling.Thats an area of concern for us, he said.Among the other owners in attendance were Fred Wilpon of the Mets, Mark Attanasio of the Brewers, Mark Walter of the Dodgers and Tom Werner of the Red Sox.The freeagent market has been slower than usual this winter, with 51 players finalizing contracts as of Wednesday.Definitely an anomaly, said Neil Leibman, chairman of the ownership committee for the Texas Rangers. Theres a lot of teams looking at next years freeagent market, which is going to be the largest in a long time.Attanasio agreed the market has slowed, but said, The season isnt over yet. Its sort of like the seventh inning.Jordan Howards criticism of basic offense highlights Bears complex problem Bulls acquire 1stround pick, Omer Asik from Pelicans for Nikola Mirotic Josh McDaniels, John DeFilippo both praise Bears and Ryan Pace for hiring process Privacy Policy Major League Baseball Arizona Diamondbacks Milwaukee Brewers Texas Rangers
59 Off-duty police officer fatally shot in downtown Chicago CHICAGO  An offduty police officer was shot and killed at the James R. Thompson Center in downtown Chicago on Tuesday afternoon, authorities said. The officer was later identified as 53yearold Cmdr. Paul Bauer of the citys 18th District.Tactical officers were on routine patrol Tuesday and observed an individual acting suspiciously around 2:30 p.m. When they tried speak with the individual, a physical struggle ensued and the person escaped, Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson said during a news conference.Bauer, a 31year veteran, was in the area, overheard police radio transmission and confronted the individual, Johnson said. An armed physical confrontation ensued and Bauer was shot multiple times, he added.Johnson said the suspect is in custody and police have recovered the weapon.I ask the citizens of this city keep the Bauer family in their prayers, Johnson said, adding that he would meet with his wife and daughter. Its a difficult day for us. We will get through it. I ask the city for their thoughts and prayers  any loss of life is tragic.Witnesses told CBS Chicago that police officers warned residents to get off the streets shortly after shots were fired, and began blocking off the streets and entrances to the Thompson Center.They actually had us locked in Walgreens, one person in the area said. They taped it off, so we couldnt get out. Just for a minute, and then they all hopped in their cop cars, and they all went south on Clark.Gov. Bruce Rauner tweeted condolences to Bauers family and colleagues Tuesday.Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and colleagues of the officer tragically lost in a shooting at the Thompson Center today.

61 Snow blankets Chicago as winter storm sweeps U.S. Midwest | News | WIBQ Snow blankets Chicago as winter storm sweeps U.S. Midwest Friday, February 09, 2018 2:45 p.m. EST Vehicles covered in snow are seen in Chicago, U.S., February 9, 2018 in this picture obtained from social media. TWITTER@MUMBLESNMAKEUPvia By Suzannah Gonzales CHICAGO Reuters  A winter storm swept across the northern U.S. Midwest on Friday, dumping up to nine inches 23 cm of snow on Chicago and snarling hundreds of flights as it rolled east to threaten New York state and New England. Chicagos metropolitan area was blanketed with its heaviest snowfall since at least late 2016 as the storm put an icy grip on much of Wisconsin, northern Illinois and Michigan. The snow caused dozens of crashes on icy Chicago expressways as residents of the thirdbiggest U.S. city struggled to get to work and to dig out from a storm system that had stretched from Montana to Michigan. I hate you, Chicago Ieva Urbietyte, a 25yearold customer service representative, said she thought while cleaning snow off her car in the Windy City. Thankfully we dont have to do this all the time. Weather forecasters in Detroit warned that snowfall there could surpass one inch 2.5 cm an hour as the system headed east. At the Argus Farm Stop in nearby Ann Arbor, Michigan, several customers arrived on skis, and store manager Laura Barch said she was eager to get into her snowshoes. I feel like this is going to be the one day out of the year to use them, said Barch. This is the first real winter weve had in several years. Wind chill temperatures were expected to drop below 0 Fahrenheit 18 C in many areas across the upper Midwest. The central and northern Rockies also will see heavy snow, the National Weather Service said. City officials announced school closures in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee because of the weather. National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley said on Friday that the system was likely to drop another four or five inches 10 or 12.5 cm of snow on the Midwest by the evening as it headed east toward New England. The storm could dump up to a foot 30 cm of snow in New York state as it picks up moisture off the Great Lakes, he added. About 1,500 U.S. flights were canceled, with about a third of flights into or out of Chicago and Detroit airports called off, according to FlightAware.com , which tracks airline traffic. Winter weather this week killed people in accidents in the Midwest, including six in Iowa, two in Missouri and one in Montana, local media in those states reported.

62 Rauner wants lawmakers&#39; help to cut state workers&#39; health insurance by $470 million - Chicago Tribune For the fourth time in as many years, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner has pointed to state workers health care as a way to save money, but this time hes asking lawmakers to help him get it done.The governors budget proposal unveiled Wednesday calls for cutting 470 million spent on public worker health insurance, an idea unions and the courts have blocked before.This time, Rauner is asking the General Assembly to change the law that requires health benefits for public workers be negotiated through collective bargaining. It could be a tall order, though, as Democratic Senate President John Cullerton has already dismissed the idea as something thats just not going to happen.For more than three years, Rauner and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union have been in a contract negotiations stalemate, which has kept state workers current health benefits unchanged.That means state, university and community college employees have continued to receive benefits in which the state picks up 83 percent of the cost of their insurance premiums. When copays and deductibles are factored in, state workers pay less than onequarter of their total health care costs, according to state data. The plan is considered platinum plus under the Affordable Care Act s metallic rating system that ranks plans as either bronze, silver, gold or platinum.Rauner wants to get the states portion of health care costs down to 60 percent, with employees paying the remaining 40 percent. He contends the state cant afford to offer a more generous health plan, given Illinois ongoing financial troubles. Such a shift would lower the plan rankings to silver or gold, depending on how the premiums and other costsharing were distributed.We recommend rightsizing employee health insurance plans so that government compensation is more in line with what the taxpayers have who are paying for it, Rauner said in his Wednesday budget address. State government needs to do what every employer in Illinois has done over the last 10 years: Get its health care costs under control. Taxpayers shouldnt have to pay for government health insurance policies that are richer than ones they can afford for themselves.AFSCME Council 31 Executive Director Roberta Lynch slammed the proposal as recycling wellworn assaults on public service workers and retirees and said the governor was looking to the wrong people for help in righting the states finances.He wants to impose unaffordably high health care costs, undermine retirement security and weaken union rights, Lynch said. All this from a wealthy CEO whos never asked his fellow millionaires and billionaires to do their part to address our states very real problems.Rauner also will have a tough time persuading lawmakers to go along with the idea. Democrats who control both the state House and Senate tend to be allied with organized labor, and some Republicans who represent districts with high numbers of union households also can be reluctant to vote against those interests.If he wants health care savings, he needs to take charge and negotiate with the workers union, Cullerton said. Thats an executive responsibility.In past years, Rauner has envisioned making the health care cuts on his own, and hes baked the anticipated cost savings into his budget proposals. That money has never materialized, though, because Rauner and AFSCME have never agreed to a contract.Over the nearly three years since AFSCMEs contract has been up for renewal, Rauner and lawmakers also havent set aside enough money to pay for the health care program, so the state is about 1.7 billion behind in paying claims. And it owes more than 500 million in interest, much of it from the bills that piled up since Rauner took office, according to data provided by the comptrollers office.Had Rauner and the union been able to reach an agreement in their contract talks over the past few years, the state might have been able to save on some of those costs.AFSCME contends that it offered in contract talks that workers could pay 8.5 percent higher premiums than theyre paying now. But the Rauner administration contends that move wouldnt save enough money.And the offer only came after a state labor board ruled that the two sides were past the point of being able to negotiate a deal and that Rauner should be allowed to impose his final contract terms, with the union having the option to strike. AFSCME turned to a state appellate court, which blocked Rauner from imposing his contract terms while it considers the case. It is still ongoing.In the years leading up to the impasse ruling, the two sides remained far apart on the issue, according to an administrative law judge at the state Labor Relations Board who analyzed the negotiations.The judge found that Rauners negotiating team consistently indicated its need to save hundreds of millions of dollars in health insurance costs and always pushed for a costsharing deal that would drop the states share to 60 percent, while the union consistently indicated its unwillingness to reach an agreement that resulted in employees paychecks being significantly smaller. In its opening offer, the union pushed for a plan that kept premiums where they are and added benefits, making it more expensive for the state, the judge found.Rauner on Wednesday cast the health insurance expenses, along with pension costs, as makeorbreak issues for Illinois finances, warning that inaction on them would mean our finances will continue to deteriorate, our economy will remain sluggish and our tax burdens will stay high and keep rising.kgeiger@chicagotribune.com Twitter @kimgeiger RELATED Rauner budget proposal at odds with reelection rhetoric  Home health care workers sue Rauner for withholding 48centanhour pay hike  Drinking alcohol more important than exercise for living past 90, study says Sylvester Stallone is not dead  at least thats what he says Sorry Elizabeth Swaney, Olympics should be reserved for the best athletes   Healthcare Policies and Laws Health Insurance Bruce Rauner John Cullerton Illinois General Assembly Affordable Care Act

66 Reborn and revitalized, the Minnesota Orchestra returns to Chicago Reborn and revitalized, the Minnesota Orchestra returns to Chicago Mon Jan 29, 2018 at 11:43 am By Tim Sawyier Osmo Vnsk conducted the Minnesota Orchestra Sunday afternoon at Symphony Center. On Sunday afternoon the Minnesota Orchestra returned to Orchestra Hall for the first time in over five decades. The ensemble has persevered through an extended musician lockout and dire financial challenges in recent years. With that drama well behind them now, under the leadership of music director Osmo Vnsk, the Minnesotans delivered bracing readings of repertory cornerstones in a showing well worth the wait. The matinee performancethe second and final installment of the seasons Symphony Center Presents Orchestra Seriesopened with the music of Jean Sibelius. Vnsk is unsurpassed in the interpretation of his countrymans oeuvre, as demonstrated in his deft handling of the Finnish composers tone poem En Saga . The hushed opening string arpeggios created an icy stasis, below which Vnsk artfully shaped long churning lines. Principal violist Rebecca Albers solos were urgently breathless throughout, and Gabriel Campos Zamoras elegiac clarinet solo in the closing section brought this deeply psychological work to a reflective close. Perhaps most impressive here and throughout the afternoon was the focused sonority of Minnesota string sections, which had a dark, earthy timbre, even at incredibly soft dynamics. The programs centerpiece was Tchaikovskys Piano Concerto No. 1 with Inon Barnatan as the solo protagonist. There is little music more familiar than the first five minutes of this beloved work, yet between Vnsk and Barnatan the famed introduction fell somewhat flat. Tchaikosky marks this movement Allegro non troppo e molto maestoso, but soloist and conductor erred too far on the side of the qualifiers and lost the Allegro. Their expansive, rounded approach compromised the openings ardor, resulting in a treacly wash. After this sentimentalized opening, the performance safely found its footing. Mozart was Tchaikovskys favorite composer and Barnatans approach was in many ways Mozartean, his playing incisive and lean. At times one wanted more force from the Israeli pianist, particularly in the opening movement. Still, there are enough pianists who storm through this score with bombast to spare, and his more restrained approach was ultimately compelling. The transparent Andantino benefited most, its middle scherzando section fleet and acrobatic. Barnatan provided ample brio in the closing Allegro con fuoco, giving blistering treatment to the finales pyrotechnics. The second half was devoted to Beethovens Symphony No. 7, which received an invigorating reading from Vnsk and the Minnesotans. The expansive introduction was well paced, and the ensuing Vivace light on its feet yet also visceral in impact. Throughout Vnsk astutely highlighted details in the backing string parts, infusing vitality into the familiar orchestral textures. The Allegretto also showcased the exquisite playing of the Minnesota string sections, especially at the softest dynamic levels, which were barely audible yet resonated even in Orchestra Halls dry acoustic. The Presto had ample vitality, and its trios were imbued with a regal sheen from the whole ensemble. The closing Allegro con brio went with incendiary abandon, bringing the program to an emphatic close and receiving a deserved standing ovation. By way of an encore Vnsk returned to Sibelius for the composers Dance Intermezzo, Op. 45 No. 2. This bonbon made for a charming, threeminute sendoff, highlighted by characterful solos from the orchestras woodwind principals.
67 Chicago trader is accused of stealing $2 million in cryptocurrency in city&#39;s first bitcoin fraud case A 24yearold Chicago trader has been charged with fraud for allegedly stealing 2 million in bitcoin and another cryptocurrency from his employer to cover personal trading losses.It is the first criminal prosecution in Chicago involving digital currencies, according to federal prosecutors.Joseph Kim appeared in U.S. District Court in Chicago on Friday, flanked by his attorneys, as U.S. Magistrate Judge Daniel G. Martin presided over the brief hearing. Kim, wearing a rumpled blazer and dark pants, was charged with one count of wire fraud. He did not enter a plea.Kim was an assistant trader for Consolidated Trading, a Chicago firm that recently formed a group to trade in increasingly popular cryptocurrencies, according to the complaint. From September to November, the complaint claims Kim transferred at least 2 million of the firms bitcoin and Litecoin for his personal use, and then made false statements to conceal the theft, until it was ultimately uncovered by Consolidateds management.Kims bond was set at 100,000, and he was limited to travel between northern Illinois and Arizona, where he has a residence. He relinquished his passport, and agreed to other restrictions as part of the bond deal, including not communicating with his former coworkers.Bitcoin has seen a meteoric rise  and a fair amount of volatility  in the last year as its popularity became more mainstream and the price of a single bitcoin surged from about 1,000 in early 2017 to around 15,000 at years end. The price now stands around 10,000. Litecoin is valued at about 220.In December, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the CBOE Futures Exchange became the first traditional exchanges to begin trading cryptocurrency futures, lending legitimacy to the digital asset and opening the door for more traditional traders to bet on its future.sbomkamp@chicagotribune.comTwitter @SamWillTravelDog food withdrawn over euthanasia drug concerns State Farm cutting IT workers at Bloomington headquarters Another 7,000 apartments expected in downtown Chicago within 2 years Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Theft Bitcoin

73 Hoover’s two-hit shutout pushes No. 8 LSU past Illinois-Chicago Save Amid first game jitters, senior pitcher Carley Hoovers dominance on the mound brought No. 8 LSU to a 30 season opening win over IllinoisChicago. Hoover dominated on the mound, only allowing two hits and counting 12 strikeouts. She didnt allow a baserunner until the fourth inning, when she walked one batter. Junior catcher Michaela Schlattman was working real well for me, Hoover said. I trusted her behind the plate. She did great out there for her first outing and Im excited to see what other catchers and pitchers do this season. LSU coach Beth praised Hoovers ability to make it look easy against an IllinoisChicago team that held their own throughout the game. Behind Hoover, the rest of the defense was solid. Four new faces stepped on the field, including junior second baseman Becca Schulte, freshman Shelbi Sunseri, freshman Taryn Antoine and Schlattman. Schlattman steps behind the plate following the graduation of former LSU allAmerican Sahvanna Jaquish and found a way to control the game and the team. I liked seeing the way the team competed, Torina said. Michaela did a great job behind the plate. Its nice to see the freshman get some at bats. Im sure theyd like to see some different results but every atbat matters and every time they see the field, theyre going to be better. Both teams remained scoreless until the fifth inning when LSU broke it open with a series of sacrifice bunts. I think it was just a little bit of first game nervousness, junior Shemiah Sanchez said. Everybody coming out tight and scared to mess up. Soon as we got going I think it was pretty good. After Schulte walked, junior shortstop Amber Serrett bunted for LSUs first hit of the game. Another sacrifice bunt by Sunseri put runners on second and third. Antoine then singled down the right field line to put LSU up 10 in the bottom of the fifth. The Tigers took complete control of the game in the bottom the the sixth, scoring two more runs off an RBI groundout by sophomore Amanda Doyle and an RBI double by Sanchez. It was really fun to just mesh with everyone out on the field, Hoover said. I think opening night bring a lot of nervousness and jitters and its almost like we can play softball now. Im glad thats out of the way, we got the win and we can move on. LSU returns to Tiger Park on Friday to kick off the annual Tiger Classic against UTArlington at 5 p.m.

78 Chicago Bulls: Nikola Mirotic thanks city of Chicago and Bulls&#39; fans Chicago Bulls: Nikola Mirotic thanks city of Chicago and Bulls fansK.C. Johnson of the Chicago Tribune reported the Bulls will also send a secondround draft pick and will receive a firstround pick from the Pelicans with the option to swap secondround selections in a future draft.Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN was told by sources that the two teams are finalizing a trade.Originally, Mirotic was to be sent to New Orleans in exchange for big man Omer Asik and a firstround pick.Mirotic is averaging a careerbest 16.8 points and 6.4 rebounds. He can be a free agent in the offseason, and theres nearly no chance Chicago wouldve exercised his club option. During his first stay, Asik was a serviceable backup to Joakim Noah he averaged eight points and 2.3 blocks per 36 minutes through his first couple of seasons in Chicago.Nuggets Gary Harris nails gamewinning triple to crush ThunderThe Nuggets will now set their sights on the Golden State Warriors who will pay a visit to Pepsi Center on Saturday. It also featured Paul George hitting a insane clutch threepointer with a couple seconds left in the game to tie it.Fighting through the awkwardness and resentment, it has been understood and seen from his play that Mirotic did everything in his power to act as a professional after the unfortunate events, but in the end, he wanted out and the Bulls made it happen. Quickly and consistently, it became evident the Bulls would work to trade Mirotic, who sought elsewhere a starting spot he lost to rookie Lauri Markkanen after winning it in training camp. On the season, they are 1411 when he plays and 422 when he doesnt. He was making 17.8 million in the final season of a threeyear, 50 million deal.But Nikola Mirotic might not be the Pelicans only get this season. This type of deal allows us to put Paul and Cris out on the floor more than theyve been all season long. And thats not even counting Mirotic potentially vetoing this deal. Hes the only active player from the Balkan country, with the most recently retired native being Nikola Pekovic, who last played in the league in 2016.Paxson also mentioned that point guard Cameron Payne should be recovered from his foot injury shortly after the AllStar break, and the Bulls want to take a look at him as well. That means Mirotic would likely be on the move again. Id say probably not. Still, New Orleans is in a bind and this is potentially the bestcase scenario for salvaging their season. But the ripple effects  who picks up the waived players, how this affects the Monroe pursuit and the NBA Draft implications  are all yet to be determined.

81 &#39;Frasier&#39; star, Chicago theater staple Mahoney dies at 77 Frasier star and Chicago theater veteran John Mahoney, the Britishborn actor who called Oak Park home, has died.He was 77.Mahoney, a member of the Steppenwolf Theatre Company for 39 years, was in hospice when he died Sunday due to complications from cancer, according to a statement from the theater. He made his final stage appearance there last fall in The Rembrandt.While he appeared in numerous Chicago area theater productions over the years, Mahoney was best known for playing cranky Martin Crane  father of Kelsey Grammers title character  on the NBC sitcom Frasier from 1993 to 2004. The role earned him two Emmy nominations. Recently, he made guest appearances on TVs Hot in Cleveland and Foyles War.Despite his success in Hollywood, the Oak Park resident remained committed to theater, specifically Chicago theater. And he embodied the citys muscular, nofrills acting style.It was a true privilege to work with him ... He was truly great, said BJ Jones, artistic director for Skokies Northlight Theatre where Mahoneys credits included Better Late, A Life and The Outgoing Tide.A longtime friend and collaborator, Jones last directed Mahoney in 2014s Chapatti. In a 2014 interview with this newspaper, Mahoney characterized his work with Jones as his best.He gave us a tremendous gift with his artistry, said Jones, who described Mahoneys performances as heroic.There were times when he dealt with health issues and he would power through so bravely, because he would rather be on stage in front of an audience eight times a week than in front of a camera, Jones said.Jones said being a star never mattered to Mahoney, who earned a 1986 Tony Award for his performance in John Guares The House of Blue Leaves and whose film career included roles in the Chicagoset thriller Primal Fear, as well as Say Anything ..., Barton Fink and The American President.He was more crazy about being an actor, Jones said. Hed be so jazzed about the connection he had with an audience.Steppenwolf canceled an opening night performance of You Got Older Monday and issued a statement on Facebook. John was a beloved member of our Steppenwolf family who was known for his extraordinary kindness, generosity of spirit and quick smile, the statement read. He performed in more than 30 Steppenwolf productions  from his breakthrough role in Orphans in 1985 to most recently The Rembrandt this past September. Johns impact on this institution, on Chicago theatre, and the world of arts and entertainment is great and will endure.Jones remembered his friend as a sweet, generous man who routinely treated the entire Northlight cast and crew to dinner, during which they all swapped stories.He was an actor down to his core, but above all of that he was just a human being, said Jones. Such a mensch. The Associated Press contributed to this report.  Celebrity Oak Park Chicago Obituaries Theater

86 Illinois State Board of Education to revamp PARCC exams Illinois State Board of Education to revamp PARCC exams Originally published February 9, 2018 at 10:19 am Share story The Associated Press The Associated Press CHICAGO AP  The Illinois State Board of Education is planning to transform third to eighthgrade state exams, aiming to shorten the tests, get results faster and switch to a format that adjusts the difficulty of test questions. The Chicago Tribune reports that the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers exam has had issues since its launch in 2015. School officials criticized the long hours of the tests. Complaints from parents led to an optout movement that kept students from getting tested. The state has pulled the exam from the roster of high school assessments following complaints from administrators who say the exams took away from instruction. Any changes to the exam wont affect high schools. Most Read Stories

88 Chicago Cubs Rumors: Yu Darvish Still On Cubs’ Radar But They Trail Brewers February 4, 2018 Chicago Cubs Rumors: Yu Darvish Still On Cubs Radar But They Trail Brewers The MLB pitching phenomenon still has a number of teams trying to acquire him with Chicago among them. Matt Slocum  AP Images Matt Couden There have been a number of teams mentioned in the MLB rumors that are vying for pitcher Yu Darvishs services, and the Chicago Cubs still have him on their radar. Thats the latest word from various sources that suggest Chicago still is looking to add to the depth of their pitching as they pursue another postseason run. However, Chicago may have a tough time bringing Darvish on board based on their reported expectations and several other MLB teams may still be ahead of them in the Yu Darvish sweepstakes this offseason. On Thursday, Fan Rag Sports  Jon Heyman gave an update on various teams offseason situations including the Chicago Cubs. With pitching depth an offseason pursuit, Darvish is still on their radar. Heyman noted that the team has hopes that Darvish will be willing to sign with them in lieu of signing with a team giving a higher payout. Since their offer isnt going to be as high as other teams, Heyman says that the Milwaukee Brewers could be ahead of Chicago in terms of bringing Darvish on board their roster. However, he also points out the fact that playing for a contender like the Cubs in a great city like Chicago could be all the reason that Darvish needs. Yu Darvish is still on the Cubs radar but theyre likely behind the Brewers in terms of their offer. Matt Slocum  AP Images While the Cubs have Darvish on the radar, they may need to settle on a different option if money lures him elsewhere. In a recent interview with ESPN s Jesse Rogers, Chicago Cubs General Manager Jed Hoyer reiterated his teams need for pitching. On the pitching side, I like the additions, but were still looking to add depth. Thats an annual thing you think about. You prepare for injuries even if some years you go unscathed. While Hoyer didnt specifically mention Yu Darvish, a recent Chicago SunTimes poll from Steve Greenberg asked fans which pitcher fans wanted most on the roster. The options were Jake Arrieta, Alex Cobb, and Yu Darvish . Darvish finished second with 37 percent of the total votes while Arrieta was first with 41 percent. In such a close vote, Greenberg contended that maybe fans were giving Darvish a lot of votes due to believing that the grass is greener with him on the roster. Still, Darvish could boost the pitching rotation as the Cubs try to battle teams such as Washington and Los Angeles next season. The Dodgers, who were on the cusp of winning this past seasons World Series, are also considered a team that could keep Darvish as part of their rotation. As theyll be attempting to make another run and are amongst the favorites to win it all, one would have to think that if they can offer more money than Chicago has on the table, Darvish will remain on board. He may even have redemption on his mind by staying with Los Angeles next season. Lately, the MLB offseason has been relatively quiet since bigger moves took place including Giancarlo Stanton and Andrew McCutchen moving to new teams. However, once Yu Darvishs decision is finally made, it could shake things up again. It will definitely give more of an edge to one teams pitching staff next season as they look to make their push. It will be interesting to see if its the Chicago Cubs who are able to sway him to join the roster, or if another teams monetary offer is just too good to pass up.

94 Patriots open as favorite over Eagles in Super Bowl - Chicago Tribune Oddsmakers like the chances of Tom Brady winning a sixth Super Bowl ring, making the New England Patriots nearly a touchdown favorite to beat the Philadelphia Eagles .Sports books around Las Vegas opened the Patriots around a 6point favorite Sunday to win their second straight Super Bowl. They also made New England a big favorite to win the Super Bowl next year in Atlanta.But the closest thing to a lock in this gambling city is that betting on this Super Bowl will smash the existing record of 138.5 million set just last year.Sports betting couldnt be more popular than it is now, said Jay Kornegay of the Westgate Las Vegas sports book. That combined with the fan base of the Eagles and the strong economy will mean a record handle on this game.Bookmakers posted their opening lines early in the fourth quarter of the Eagles Vikings game, with lines ranging between 5 and 6 12 points. The overunder in most books for total points scored in the game was 48.Bettors didnt take long to weigh in themselves, with one gambler taking the 6 points and putting a big bet on the Eagles at the South Point resort before their rout of the Minnesota Vikings was even over.Our first bet was 10,000 on the Eagles, said Jimmy Vaccaro, oddsmaker at the South Point.Bettors jammed into sports books Sunday for the two conference championship games, with millions wagered in person and millions more bet on phone apps. Bookmakers had a good day, with most winning money on both games.That shouldnt change in the Super Bowl, where bookmakers have turned a profit every time except the 2008 game when the New York Giants upset the previously unbeaten and 12point favorite Patriots.At the Westgate, Kornegay said the opening line of the Patriots minus5.5 points was made knowing there would be money coming in from both the Eagles rabid fan base and by bettors who simply have a dislike for the dominance of Brady and the Patriots.This is the only event where we make a line that depends on public opinion, Kornegay said. Theres so much more money from the public on this game than you would get from the socalled sharks. They come in here and they just dont want to root for the Patriots.Unlike the games preceding it, a lot of the money on the Super Bowl comes from socalled prop bets that often crossover to other sports. Some of the bigger sports books will put up several hundred prop bets later this week that will include the coin flip and other possibilities that having nothing to do with the final score of the game.Its much easier to do lots of props with Brady, Vaccaro said. Either you love him or you hate him. Half the people bet on him to see him win and half bet to see him lose.One of the more popular prop bets is whether there will be a safety in the game, and Vaccaro said about 15,000 was wagered on either side of that prop even before the second game ended Sunday.Oddsmakers at the William Hill chain also made the Patriots a 92 favorite to win next years Super Bowl in Atlanta, followed by the Eagles at 172.Aly Raismans mom rips into Michigan State coach Tom Izzo: Are you a moron Free from Tom Thibodeau, Bulls Zach LaVine in good hands Larry Nassar case shows courage of victims, shamefulness of enablers Privacy Policy Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune New England Patriots Philadelphia Eagles Tom Brady Minnesota Vikings New York Giants

Thats the first time I played with a mouthpiece in a basketball game, just a lot of adjustments Ive got to figure out.Lauri Markkanen also was selected to play in the Rising Stars game. He and Dunn would be on opposite sides if they both participate, since the game is a United States vs. the World format.Its going to be fun going against Kris, for the most part, Markkanen said. Hes going to iso me a little bit. We talked about it. So Ill try to hold my own.Trade deadline looms: The NBAs trade deadline is Thursday at 2 p.m., Central time.

Hopefully we can meet up at some point.Of the players acquired from New Orleans, center Omer Asik is expected to be a regular member of the team.

Ray Jr. as its new president, succeeding Rev. Dr. Alice Hunt , who announced her retirement last February. Ray will become the 13th president in the seminarys 164year history on February 1, 2018 .Rev. Dr. Stephen G. Ray, Jr., President, Chicago Theological Seminary Chicago Theological Seminary Dr. Ray brings an incredibly deep understanding of the changing cultural and religious landscape facing theological education. His 30 plus years of experience equip him not only to see the challenges, but to identify and articulate the possibilities ahead, said Norman J. Williams , chair of the Seminarys board of trustees. A renowned theological scholar, Rays appointment has been met with enthusiasm across the seminary world and by theological leaders and the United Church of Christ UCC where he is an ordained minister.Having worked closely with Dr. Ray, I am thrilled to learn that Chicago Theological Seminary has called him as their next president, said Rev. John C. Dorhauer , UCC general minister and president. He brings a solid foundation of theological sophistication and a deep awareness of emerging racial, political, and cultural realities.

We are committed to developing citizens of the future who unabashedly, and unashamedly champion justice, mercy, and the inherent value of every human being, said Dr. Ray. Alice Hunt moved CTS forward with her commitment to innovation. Her inspirational leadership led the Seminary to think differently and execute new models, continued Dr. Ray. Theological education is at a critical juncture, amid downward trends in enrollment, and unconscionable burdens put upon those taking on student debt. Yet, I am certain that we have the tools necessary to confront these challenges and seize the opportunities facing theological education, its institutions, and the students we serve, to make our religiously plural world wiser, more merciful and just than ever before.Prior to being called to lead CTS, Ray served as the Neal F. and Ila A.

The board named Donald C. Clark, Jr. , counselor at law, entrepreneur, retired general counsel for the UCC, and past CTS board chair, as acting president. CTSs executive committee appointed a committee representative of the wider CTS community to conduct the search.

105 Drinking alcohol more important than exercise for living past 90, study says Chicago Tribune Cheers to life  seriously.When it comes to making it into your 90s, booze actually beats exercise, according to a longterm study.The research, led by University of California neurologist Claudia Kawas, tracked 1,700 nonagenarians enrolled in the 90 Study that began in 2003 to explore impacts of daily habits on longevity.Researchers discovered that subjects who drank about two glasses of beer or wine a day were 18 percent less likely to experience a premature death, the Independent reports.Meanwhile, participants who exercised 15 to 45 minutes a day, cut the same risk by 11 percent.I have no explanation for it, but I do firmly believe that modest drinking improves longevity, Kawas stated over the weekend at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual conference in Austin, Texas.Other factors were found to boost longevity, including weight. Participants who were slightly overweight  but not obese  cut their odds of an early death by 3 percent.Its not bad to be skinny when youre young but its very bad to be skinny when youre old, Kawas noted in her address.Subjects who kept busy with a daily hobby two hours a day were 21 percent less likely to die early, while those who drank two cups of coffee a day cut that risk by 10 percent.Further study is needed to determine how habits impact longevity beyond peoples genetic makeups.As alcohol gender gap narrows, womens risk of addiction increasesMixing energy drinks with alcohol may make dangerous cocktailHeres why you shouldnt get a massage after drinking alcoholAhh Valentines Day, the holiday of love.

106 Review: The Humans (Broadway in Chicago) The Humans   Playwright Stephen Karam , also known for Speech and Debate , has been adapting Chekhov of late. His take on The Cherry Orchard went up on Broadway in 2016 the same year The Humans won the Tony Award for Best Play. His film adaptation of The Seagull, starring Annette Bening, is forthcoming this year. This is fitting, as The Humans has very Chekhovian elements: family dynamics, old memories, and differing viewpoints clashing on major and minor levels. Leaving the plays opening night performance in Chicago, I heard several audience members saying, I dont get it. I respectfully disagree: I got it, and then some. Thoughtfully directed by Joe Mantello , the first national tour of the Broadway hit chronicles a family Thanksgiving dinner with realistic  and haunting  results. Struggling composer Brigid Blake  Daisy Eagan  is hosting her family for Thanksgiving in the New York City apartment she shares with her older boyfriend, graduate student Richard  Luis Vega . The duplex is large and slightly offkilter, much like the Blakes themselves. Patriarch Erik  Richard Thomas  dearly loves his youngest daughter but cant understand why she wants to live in such a city, such a flat. Mom Dierdre  Pamela Reed  is busy taking care of her wheelchairbound motherinlaw Momo  Lauren Klein , who is struggling with dementia. Still, Dierdre cant resist little digs at Brigids livinginsin situation. Meanwhile, older sister Aimee  Therese Plaehn  is losing her job due to a chronic illness, and has recently broken up with her longtime girlfriend. As they nibble on appetizers, drink in the Irish way read: a lot, and banter back and forth, the faulty electricity and loud noises of the old apartment building portend a dark undercurrent. Watching The Humans , I realized that there is something eerie about living in an older apartment building, as many of us citydwellers do. Privacy basically doesnt exist. Youre never fully alone, and though this can be comforting, its also a bit disturbing that others are privy to your most intimate moments. Aided by director Mantello and a crack production team, Karams play brings this out brilliantly. As tension builds in the familys interactions, lights go out and neighbors bang from above. The effect is spectacularly unsettling, symbolic without going overboard. David Zinn s scenic design perfectly recreates the creaky floors and dirty windows of a large, cheap urban living space, even showing the thin insulation between floors. Justin Townsend s lighting is letterperfect, especially a creepy final moment involving Brigid and Erik. Ditto Fitz Patton s sound, relatable to anyone whos inhabited a shared living space. The dialogue is wonderfully authentic and even the quippy moments sound like real people talking. When secrets are revealed, its not with a bang but a whimper or several: much like real life. Everyone is wellcast, especially Thomas bestknown as John Boy from The Waltons and Eagan one of the youngestever Tony winners for her performance as Mary Lennox in The Secret Garden . The Humans is heartbreaking, but refreshing in many ways: a play about ordinary folks fumbling through life and navigating its many obstacles. Karams script, Mantellos direction and the excellent production team and cast accurately portray the fears we have, both everyday and existential, that come to a head when crossed with complex familial relationships. The Humans doesnt make a grand statement. It just is, and therein lies the genius. Rating:  The Humans continues through February 11th at Cadillac Palace Theatre , 151 W. Randolph  map . Tickets are 2290,   8007752000 or online at Ticketmaster.com   TheHumansOnBroadway.com . Running time: 90 minutes, no intermission
107 Japan takes the lead in countering China&#39;s Belt and Road Initiative - Chicago Tribune News , now finds itself playing the leading role in pushing back against Chinas grand plans to extend its influence throughout Asia and into Europe. To do so, Tokyo is increasingly joining up with other countries and especially India, launching a 200 billion infrastructure plan, and even boosting its military efforts in the broader Indian Ocean area in what is seen as a deliberate bid to counter Beijings growing heft. The effort even extends as far afield as Eastern and Central Europe, where Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a historic visit just last month.Abe has been very active in proposing an alternative to China in general and the Belt and Road in particular, said Cline Pajon, a Japan expert at the French Institute of International Relations. It serves to complicate Chinas strategic calculus and also maintain a multipolar world as much as possible. Since World War II, Japan has played a largely secondary role to the United States in Asia, sheltering under the American security umbrella while focusing on business. But now that Washington has bailed out of the single biggest project meant to push back against Chinas growing influence in Asia  the TransPacific Partnership TPP trade pact  Japan has been forced in many ways to pick up the slack. Abe appears to be embracing this role. Both times he has led Japan  from 2006 to 2007 and again since 2012  he has sought to make Tokyo a bigger player on the regional stage, even against domestic opposition. In 2016, he launched his own version of a development and security plan for Asia, designed as an explicit alternative to Chinas vision. That includes a deliberate focus on building quality infrastructure, a dig at the perceived flaws of Chinesebuilt projects. These trends were around before Trump, said Robert Dujarric, the director of the Institute of Contemporary Asian Studies at Temple University Japan. But theyve been kicked into overdrive in part to compensate for a lack of U.S. leadership, he said. Dujarric called Japans central and surprising role in salvaging the TPP even without U.S. participation exhibit A. That new role is crystallized in Japans growing strategic partnership with India. The two are working together to develop muchneeded power plants, railroads and port facilities in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar and on Indian Ocean islands. More ambitiously, theyre jointly promoting something called the AsiaAfrica Growth Corridor, an outgrowth of Abes own plan meant to deepen the economic connections between Africa and South and Southeast Asia. Not coincidentally, its positioned as an alternative to Chinas own leapfrogging across the Indian Ocean to East Africa. Japan is concerned about a rising Chinese profile beyond the Western Pacific, and India is equally concerned about the strategic implications of Chinas commercial engagements in its neighborhood, said Darshana Baruah of Carnegie India. These projects are aimed at creating an alternative to Chinas Belt and Road. In many ways, the uptick in Japaneseled plans to develop Asia  through multibilliondollar efforts including the Japan Infrastructure Initiative and the Asian Development Bank  is simply an extension of decades of Japanese overseas assistance and investment in the region. Whats markedly new is Japans effort to extend its economic influence much further afield, precisely to places such as Central and Eastern Europe that have become a focus of Beijings Belt and Road project over the past year. Abes visit in January to the Baltics and three other Eastern European nations  the first ever by a Japanese prime minister  was meant to drum up support for the JapanEU trade deal inked last year. But his visit also included a stop in Serbia  a country that isnt in the EU but which is squarely in the crosshairs of Chinas efforts to win influence through investment. The China factor seems to be a motivation for Japan in Eastern Europe, said FransPaul van der Putten of the Netherlands Institute of International Relations. Japan has been competing with China in Asia, and that competition is expanding to other areas. Not everybody is convinced that Japan is playing a spoiler role against the Belt and Road, especially since Tokyo often makes ambiguous noises about welcoming Chinese investment that could benefit the region as a whole. Japan  if not India  even suggests periodically it could end up joining the Belt and Road at some point. Seen from Islamabad, the biggest beneficiary of the Belt and Road thanks to the 60 billion ChinaPakistan Economic Corridor CPEC, not even Japan and Indias partnership represents a serious threat. India and Japan can collaborate, but the Belt and Road is too big to be countered by them, and that is why they are keeping open the option to join sooner or later, said Ahmad Rashid Malik, the director of the ChinaPakistan Study Centre at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad. Foreign Minister Kono expressed interest in the CPEC when he made a rare trek to Islamabad last month, Malik said, while big economic actors such as the Japan External Trade Organization and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation have been bullish on more investments there. Japan is not opposing the CPEC. Ultimately, the bigger question is how sustainable Japans push for a leading role will prove  and if that will leave the door ajar for China after all. Abe wont be prime minister forever, and its not clear how deep his more muscular vision of Japans place in the world has penetrated the countrys political culture. More to the point, Japan  saddled with a sluggish economy, massive debt, and an aging and shrinking population  simply doesnt have the economic or diplomatic resources to replace the United States in Asia, Dujarric said. That could limit its role to a very valuable firebreak, until Washington sorts out whether it really wants to retreat or reengage with the world. If Trump is just a temporary ailment, Dujarric said, Japan can serve as a major BandAid until sanity returns to the U.S.

112 CHICAGO: 20 Inches Snow Forecast... Latest Chicago Snow Forecast: Total 13 To 17 Inches Over Weekend Possible February 8, 2018 at 2:14 pm UPDATE: Forecast improving. Now expect about 10 inches by Sunday. CHICAGO CBS  A total of up to 17 inches of snow could fall by the end of the weekend, a worstcase scenario that could put this event on par with some of the biggest in history. Starting tonight, snow will start falling and intensify overnight, with 6 to 12 inches of snow on the ground by noon. Some isolated areas may see 14 inches of snow on the ground. Schools and businesses were already announcing closings Heavy snow is expected to spread across northern Illinois early this evening, then continue into Friday. Travel tonight into Friday will likely be very difficult to impossible at times. Avoid any unnecessary travel. pic.twitter.comJqOCoUWpz5  NWS Chicago @NWSChicago February 8, 2018 Then, a second event will sweep into the area on Saturday, with one to three inches possible. If the storm dumps numbers in the higher range, the 17 inches would put it among the biggest ever. However, for recordkeeping purposes, the entire event might not be considered one single storm. The band of the heaviest snow is fairly narrow, so totals could vary. Heres a first look at the forecasted start time of the snow tonight. pic.twitter.comspVLhnadxE  NWS Chicago @NWSChicago February 8, 2018 With so much snow on the way, local and state road crews were planning for a very busy start to the weekend, in an effort to keep roads clear. The Illinois Department of Transportation maintains a fleet of 1,700 trucks used to plow and salt nearly 16,000 miles of Interstates and other state roads across Illinois when it snows. Last year, IDOT used more than 300,000 tons of salt. Meantime, the Chicago Department of Streets and Sanitation will deploy its full fleet of plows Thursday night. When it snows, the city starts by plowing and salting the citys main streets and Lake Shore Drive until the snow stops, then starts clearing side streets. We are going to be working all night to clear the streets, Mayor Emanuel said at a news conference on Thursday. Leave yourself time to get to work and get home. The mayor urged residents to check on sick and elderly neighbors to make sure they are safe. The city is ready for this, Emanuel said. This is a heavy snow, the heaviest we have seen in a couple of winters. Given that this storm is expected to last a full day, some side streets might not get plowed until Friday night.

The offduty police commander was shot and killed Tuesday afternoon in downtown Chicago after he spotted a man matching the radio description of an armed suspect officers were chasing on foot, the citys police superintendent said. Nuccio DiNuzzoChicago Tribune via AP Nuccio DiNuzzo Save CHICAGO AP  The shooting death of a police commander near a state government office building gripped parts of downtown Chicago as emergency workers tried to save the department veteran at the scene and officers shackled the suspect. Cmdr. Paul Bauer was shot multiple times Tuesday afternoon after he spotted a man matching the radio description of an armed suspect, the citys police superintendent said. Bauer saw the offender and engaged in an armed physical confrontation, Superintendent Eddie Johnson said. Officers had been chasing the man on foot. Bauer, 53, had been on the police force 31 years. Johnson choked back tears as he spoke to reporters outside Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where Bauer was pronounced dead. I just ask the citizens of this city to keep the Bauer family in their prayers, he said. A procession of law enforcement vehicles took Bauers body to the medical examiners office. Mayor Rahm Emanuel called Bauers death a tragic reminder of the dangerous duty the men and women of our police department accept to ensure the safety of us all. The shooting occurred near the James R. Thompson Center. Johnson said officers initially confronted the suspect because he was acting suspiciously. Police captured the man a short time later, and a gun was recovered at the scene, he said. It was initially reported that Bauer was offduty, but police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter late Tuesday that Bauer was onduty. He said in an email Wednesday that it was a chaotic scene and Bauer had been attending training at the Chicago Fire Department with other officials before the shooting. There was no communication from him on the radio informing dispatch that he was in pursuit of the offender or that he was even on scene, so they initially thought it was an offduty officer until someone recognized him, Guglielmi wrote. Some initial media reports said the suspected shooter may have been involved in the robbery of a local business, but Johnson did not provide details about what the man was doing that prompted officers to want to speak with him. Witnesses to parts of the incident said they heard gunshots. I was walking down the street and I heard pop pop pop pop pop, Noreen Danko, who was on her way to her office nearby, told the Chicago Tribune. And I said to the girl next to me, Is that what I think it is And she said, Yep. I said, Aw geez. And everybody is scurrying all over and I see the police head to the stairs there. Theres a stairwell there. And it goes downstairs. I heard that the door is locked there. It used to be a pedway, but now, for security reasons they have it locked. She told the newspaper that she saw officers lead the shackled suspect away and put him in a squad car, then watched as emergency workers administered CPR to Bauer, who was lying on a stretcher, before he was put inside an ambulance and rushed to the hospital.

126 Blackhawks end losing streak at eight with 71 victory against Capitals - Chicago Tribune Forget the One Goal mantra. The Blackhawks were desperate for one win Saturday night over the Capitals.They scored seven times, which ended losing streaks of eight overall and seven at home during a 71 victory.It took the Hawks 19 minutes,59.2 seconds to score three goals, something they hadnt done in their previous six games. That helped propel them to their first win in February and first at the United Center since Jan. 12.It certainly feels 100 times better than coming in and trying to explain how we had a lead and were unable to sustain it, Hawks coach Joel Quenneville said after his team topped two goals for just the fourth time in17 games and the first in the last seven.Jonathan Toews  why not shot 6:19 into the game accidentally made its way past Braden Holtby from the right side for Hawks first score. Toews second goal in 17 games put his team ahead 10, which has been dangerous territory for the Hawks.All they had to show for the last10 times they had scored first was a 262 record.Photos from the BlackhawksCapitals game at the United Center on Saturday, Feb. 17, 2018.First goal of the game was just throwing it on the net, at his feet from sharp angles, Toews said. Those go in once in a while. That was a nice way for us to start.A little more than six minutes and a tying goal from the Capitals Tom Wilson later, Brandon Saad socked away his second goal in two games after going 16 games without one. Seconds after Tommy Wingels  shot at an open net was deflected by Dmitry Orlov , Nick Schmaltz pasted one past Holtby with 0.8 seconds left in the period to make it 31.That kind of kicks teams when theyre down, Toews said of Schmaltzs goal.Not even Patrick Kane had been immune from the teams scoring allergies. He had just one goal in his last 13 games  a span in which the Hawks went 292  and none in his previous five going into Saturday.That changed when Kane deposited a rebound of Toews shot late in the second period to put the Hawks up 41. He later collected his 500th career assist on Artem Anisimov s goal in the second to become the eighth Americanborn player to reach that number as well as 300 goals.I dont think youre really thinking about numbers too much, Kane said. When you cross certain numbers, its always a pretty cool feeling. If you play long enough and you play with good enough players, those things are inevitable.For good measure, Ryan Hartman added his first goal since Dec. 29 near the end of the second period. Anisimov netted his second in 19 games to give the Hawks three goals in a 2:07 span.Alex DeBrincat made it 71 in the third with his 22nd of the season. He retreated to the locker room shortly after he was hit by Wilson, who received a 10minute misconduct penalty, with just under four minutes left.Quenneville said DeBrincat was fine.The mood of the Hawks, who received a standing ovation from the seasonhigh crowd of 22,066, was finer.Lets see how we respond to this because theres a lot of hockey left, Quenneville said.pskrbina@chicagotribune.comTwitter @ChiTribSkrbinaPaul Skrbinas three stars1.

133 Northwest suburbs work to clear roads as snow continues to fall - Chicago Tribune Although area snowfall totals have fallen short of initial weather forecasts that predicted as much as 14 inches of snow by Friday morning, public works crews in Arlington Heights have been able to keep local streets plowed and salted partly thanks to schools cancelling classes, said Scott Shirley, public works director for Arlington Heights.By early Friday morning, the village had seen about six inches of snow, but the total is expected to grow, Shirley said.Light snow has been forecasted to fall intermittently throughout the day with one to three inches expected by Friday night and an additional one to three inches expected by Sunday morning.This snowfall seems to have scooted south, and they keep changing the forecast, so theres a lot of guesswork involved, Shirley said. But were feeling lucky today because all of the local schools are closed, which in our minds is a good thing, as it takes a lot of the traffic off the roads, and we dont have kids on the sidewalks walking to school.Stacey Wescott  Chicago Tribune Ben Brown uses a snow blower to clear his parents driveway in Barrington on Feb. 9, 2018. Ben Brown uses a snow blower to clear his parents driveway in Barrington on Feb. 9, 2018. Stacey Wescott  Chicago Tribune With weather forecasts calling for more than a foot of snow by Friday morning, most northwest suburban public and private schools decided to close Friday, including Arlington Heights School District 25, Township High School District 214, Barrington School District 220, KildeerCountryside School District 96, Lake Zurich School District 95, LincolnshirePrairie View School District 103 and Stevenson High School.District 220 Superintendent Brian Harris said he huddled with other northwest suburban administrators, including Township High School District 214 Superintendent David Schuler, during a phone conference late Thursday afternoon, leading to a clear cut decision to close schools.Everyone thought it was a good idea to close, but each district has so many variants leading up to that decision, Harris said. We got about eight inches of snow in Barrington, which is pretty significant  and its still snowing Friday.Generally, the decision to cancel classes at District 220s 12 schools largely depends on whether students safety will be at risk during inclement weather.We have 72 square miles of road in the district, and busing is a big part of our student transportation, Harris said. We also have a lot of rural, onelane roads in Barrington Hills and North Barrington, which makes driving in the snow very challenging.Stacey Wescott  Chicago Tribune Natasha Janota, 6, of Barrington, plays in a mound of snow outside of her home in Barrington on Feb. 9, 2018. Natasha Janota, 6, of Barrington, plays in a mound of snow outside of her home in Barrington on Feb. 9, 2018. Stacey Wescott  Chicago Tribune While Arlington Heights only had around six inches of snow by Friday morning, District 25 Superintendent Lori Bein said officials were confident that closing schools was definitely the right call.Bein said she also joined in a group phone call with nearby administrators from District 214 and other area elementary schools Thursday afternoon.The consensus from the meeting was crews would not have enough time in the morning to clear the roads and allow for safe passage of school buses, as well as parents who drive their children to school, since the bulk of the snowfall was expected to arrive overnight.Its a light, soft snow, but its a significant amount, and theres more on the way, Bein said. Well just have to see what Mother Nature has in store.While some parents might see the snow day as the perfect opportunity for kids to catch up on their school work, Bein suggested that families also try to enjoy the unexpected day together at home.I think its great if families can get outside and play in the snow, and then come inside to warm up and read a good story together, or watch a family movie, Bein said.Even though area students received the day off Friday, the public works department in Arlington Heights dispatched 32 employees, who started working 12hour shifts once the snowstorm started, to plow and salt local streets, Shirley said.If the predicted snowfall for late Friday and the weekend is accurate, Shirley said, Arlington Heights would be already on par with last year, with another three to six weeks of winter weather to go.We have a lot of tools in our toolbox to deal with snow, but Mother Nature can always undo our efforts, he said.In nearby Buffalo Grove, where scores of children were out in the neighborhoods Friday afternoon enjoying the more than six inches of powdery snow, public works crews cleared roads and kept a watchful eye out for youngsters playing near the street, officials said.When the crews are out plowing in the community, theyre always keeping their eyeballs on a swivel to look our for all of the kids because the biggest piles of snow are near the street, and unfortunately, thats where the kids want to build their snow forts, said Buffalo Grove Maintenance Supervisor Bryan Beitzel.Despite the slow start to the winter season, the frequent snow flurries during the past two weeks have been keeping village crews busy lately, he said.We try to stay on a consistent schedule with the same crew 12 hours on and 12 hours off because its important that the guys have a consistent sleep schedule and sufficient downtime between shifts, Beitzel said.kcullotta@tribpub.comTwitter @kcullotta High Schools Arlington Heights Barrington
134 MBB: College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin Quote: from: Titan Q on Today at 05:19:43 pm Quote: from: Gregory Sager on Today at 04:03:32 pmWhat bothered me about how the officials responded was that they disregarded his obvious intent. Its one thing to commit a hard foul, and its another thing altogether to knock a player to the floor and then stand over him for several seconds, glaring down at him with a macho, Yeah, Ive just put you on your ass. Whaddya gonna do about it look. The officials didnt respond to that at all, which disappointed me because it not only left open the potential for that provocation to turn into something worse, it also revealed the intent behind the foul itself. They didnt even come over right away to intervene my initial worry was that this incident would bring somebody off of the NPU bench, as it took place right in front of that part of the sideline they waited until Jason Hines had walked over and brushed past Knobloch as a bodyguard gesture before they scrambled over towards the NPU bench and separated the players. Given that context, the intent behind the hard foul by Knobloch on Lake under the west basket after Josh Washburns steal at about the 5:00 mark of the second half shouldve been obvious.Just watched that play. Starts at about 30:25...https:boxcast.tvviewmbbilwesleyanatnorthpark895503Didnt Lake kick Knobloch Isnt that what Knobloch stared at him for Instead of Yeah, Ive just put you on your ass. Whaddya gonna do about it wasnt it more Why TF did you just kick meYou 100 sure you are describing this accuratelyfairlyI cant believe that was the play we have had pedantic conversation about.Two kids were a little heated during a game, bumped each other and gave each other the look. Knoblach didnt even stand over him. He walked around him and got away immediately, while giving him the look. So what, they are competitors. This isnt Goon Ball in my eyes. If it happened more frequently maybe I would be worried. Reading the Quote: s it sounds like their is no bad blood between the two players, they moved on...

136 Chicago sees drop in percentage of teens using cigarettes Chicago sees drop in percentage of teens using cigarettes 12918 10:51 PM CHICAGO  Chicago public health officials say the citys teen youth smoking rate has fallen to an alltime low. The Chicago Department of Public Health said Monday that according to its Healthy Chicago report 6 percent of Chicago high school students reported smoking cigarettes in 2017. That number was 13.6 percent in 2011. About 7 percent of teens reported using cigars, 4.5 percent said they used smokeless tobacco and 6.6 percent reported electronic cigarette use. Health officials say serious health consequences are possible if young people use tobacco in any form. The report found a decline in use of cigarettes and electronic cigarettes among those ages 18 to 20. The number dropped from 15.2 percent in 2015 to 9.7 percent in 2016. The reductions come after Chicago passed a law raising the age for purchasing tobacco to 21 from 18. TAGS

WAND  Rough weather created some hurdles for a Valentines Daythemed fundraiser. The part of the Valentines Day Fun Run that dealt with actual running had to be canceled because of ice and the slick surface it caused on Decatur sidewalks. While that setback kept everyone inside, it didnt stop the annual pancake breakfast from happening. The run usually includes 1 and 3 mile trips. I woke up and got up early and was like Oh, they canceled the run, said an unnamed person involved in the Fun Run. But we still got to eat and help out and meet some new people. Sundays events still included special store hours at organizer Fleet Feet Sports from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. They, along with Ray Eldridge Jewelry, gave out raffle prizes to people who came. Donations and money from raffle ticket sales went to the track program at Millikin University. Organizers say one of the main goals of the Fun Run was to help people stay in shape.

156 Legionella ‘Possibly’ Found in Illinois Capitol Complex Legionella Possibly Found in Illinois Capitol Complex Published at 10:20 PM CST on Jan 22, 2018 Receive the latest local updates in your inbox Email Privacy policy  More Newsletters Legionella bacteria was possibly found in the Capitol Complex hot water system, an official from the Illinois Secretary of States office said Monday. The bacteria can cause Legionnaires disease but Mike Wojcik, director of physical services for the Secretary of States office, said the department was not aware of any reports of the disease among state employees or the general public. Out of an abundance of caution and because of heightened awareness and continued misconceptions about Legionnaires disease, we want to make you aware of preliminary test results that indicate the possible presence of Legionella bacteria in the Capitol Complex hot water system, Wojcik said in a memo to all Capitol Complex state employees obtained by NBC 5. Wojcik said more testing was underway and results should be available in two weeks. In the meantime, we have been advised by experts that the transmission of this bacteria in normal, daytoday office operations is unlikely, he said in the memo. Legionnaires disease is usually contracted by inhaling mist or vapor from a contaminated water source, he said. It is not contracted through drinking water or from another person. Employees were advised to not using showers in the complex and aerators were to be removed, Wojcik said. More information on a Legionella can be found here.

I was a part of the Neubauer Adelante program and absolutely loved it I took Awakening into Consciousness and cannot begin to say how much I enjoyed the Socratic Seminar style of learningthe answers were not given, they were discovered, something that was hugely different from my high schools way of teaching, and I believe to be much more intriguing. It was here that my love for learning was fully realized. But if I were to be perfectly honest, I would have to say that the part of the program I missed most was the people I encountered. All 31 of us Neubauer scholars became unimaginably close whether it was dancing to tango, exploring the city, or simply working on essays, we were always together.

164 Chicago residents wonder if a root canal dental treatment is worth it   Chicago residents wonder if a root canal dental treatment is worth it Chicago residents wonder if a root canal dental treatment is worth it   Tooth sensitivity or tenderness is a sign of a problem and needs to be addressed. This may stem from decay or trauma. Root canal dental treatment may be a solution to preserve the health of your mouth. Unfortunately, the term root canal has a bad reputation that has many patients wondering if the treatment is worth it. Throw away the misconceptions. Located in Chicago, IL , the team at Big Smile Dental is here to disprove the bad reputation and make patients aware of the health benefits of root canal treatments. Root canals are not scary. The thought of having a root canal has many patients cringing because they fear the treatment, and believe the negativity surrounding it. Forget everything you thought to be true. A root canal is not intimidating. The treatment is performed to remove the damaged or infected dental pulp. This saves the tooth and preserves the health of the oral cavity. The procedure is as routine as having a cavity treated, and it does not cause pain. Damage or decay present in a tooth can lead to infection or inflammation. This may cause sensitivity or tenderness. Visible facial swelling is possible if the patient has an abscessed tooth. It is important to seek dental help if you experience any of these symptoms. Even if the symptoms subside, the underlying infection will not clear up on its own. Dental care is needed. What is a root canal When determining if the treatment is right for you, first get rid of your preconceived, negative ideas about root canal treatment. The goal is to relieve your pain and save your tooth. When bacteria and infection have spread throughout a tooth, the pulp inside the tooth is damaged. Without treatment, the tooth may become so damaged that it cannot be saved. When the infection is caught, a root canal is often recommended to preserve the natural tooth, thus protecting the health of your mouth. Your dentists goal is to preserve as much of your natural tooth as possible. When a root canal is performed, bacteria and affected tissue are removed, and the canal is sterilized. The tooth is saved. Using a gentle, trained touch, the entire procedure is routine and comfortable. Root canal dental treatment preserves your tooth, with long lasting health benefits. Once you have forgotten your negative thoughts about root canals, you can see the benefits of this therapy are numerous. Key points to remember about root canal therapy include: The treatment is not painful. Neither the tooth nor the root is removed. The natural tooth is saved. A root canal rids the tooth of bacteria. The effects of the treatment are long lasting with proper oral health care.   If a root canal has been suggested, it is likely that you are already experiencing sensitivity due to infection or inflammation. A root canal is a routine, everyday procedure. It is as simple as having a cavity treated. The treatment relieves the tenderness and protects your oral health. Your dentist uses xrays to show the location and depth of the damage. The damaged section is removed before the tooth is disinfected and filled. The process relieves the pressure. Your symptoms subside as the tooth heals. Your dentist strives to protect your oral health. This includes the teeth, gums, and underlying structures. The point of a root canal is to save your tooth. The roots remain in place. This keeps your jawbone healthy and prevents the surrounding teeth from shifting. During the procedure, infected material is removed to ensure the remaining bacteria are eliminated. Since the bacteria is safely removed, no infection remains to make the patient ill. Your oral and overall health are improved with a root canal dental treatment. The entire procedure is safe and effective. Once the tooth has been treated, a crown is placed on top for added protection. This preserves the health of the tooth. By following good oral practices and regular dental visits, the results of your treatment are long lasting. Dont let fear stand in the way of your beautiful smile.

166 Meet American figure skater Vincent Zhou, who has been largely overshadowed by Adam Rippon and Nathan Chen - Chicago Tribune The personality of American figure skater Vincent Zhou, who made his Olympic debut with a superb short program Friday, was neatly summed up by his social media response to a fan who recently asked what era he would visit if he could travel back in time.If I time traveled, he said, I would likely end up in outer space because Earth is moving at 67,000 mph and time travel is only time travel and not spacetime travel. If you traveled back in time 1 seconds, youd be about 1,116.667 miles into space away from the surface of Earth where you were just standing. To successfully end up on Earth after time travel, science would have to find a way to make up those miles. Teleportation of matter is not possible. Yet.Clearly, this isnt your average 17yearold kid.But to answer the original question, Zhou continued in another Tweet, I would go back to 1984 to fully experience the release of Take On Me by aha.So hes not just smart, hes funny.Not just brilliant but bemusing.Part of it is from all Ive gone through, he explained. Ive gained a pretty good perspective on the world, and that helps me make appropriate and witty remarks.Despite that, Zhou has been largely overshadowed by his teammates during the Pyeongchang Olympics.The openly gay Adam Rippon has become a media darling, combining excellent skating to help the U.S. win team bronze with an unfiltered approach to interviews. The talented Nathan Chen had been tipped as a gold medal favorite until everything went awry during his short program.Together, they had held the spotlight until Zhou landed the first quad lutz in an Olympic event, and put together the best short program of his career to briefly take the lead.He wound up 12th among 30 skaters, easily qualifying for Saturdays free skate.Im happy that I committed to my jumps and Im happy that I gave it my all, Zhou said.Make no mistake, Zhou is trying to finish as high as possible during these Olympics, and a top10 result is hardly out of reach. But he also knows the next Olympics could be more his time, the moment when everything aligns and he contends for a medal.That doesnt seem so far away considering how far Zhou has already come.You see, Zhous parents emigrated from China in the early 1990s, settling in California to attend graduate school. Both became successful computer scientists in Silicon Valley, Zhous father with Google  where he still works  and his mother as a groundbreaking programmer with Oracle.It was after they had Zhou and his older sister, Vivian, that their precocious boy took an interest in figure skating. And with no toplevel coaching available in the Bay Area, the family decided that his mom, Fei Ge, would move with Zhou to Southern California in pursuit of his dream.Things became tight with only one income. Living apart from the other half of the family was tough.Zhous mother admits she thought Zhou would take figure skating to a certain level and grow tired of it, and the separation would be a shortterm arrangement. But he wound up excelling, and they would continue living and training in Southern California before moving to Colorado years later.Meanwhile, his sister became an accomplished diver, and shes now pursuing a degree in brain and cognitive science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.My family has sacrificed absolutely everything for me, Zhou said, halfjoking that his figure skating career has made him the oddball in a family of brilliant scientists. I think thats given me more maturity than a lot of kids my age.Not that Zhou isnt smart. He graduated from high school at 16.Lots of kids his age arent pondering the scientific problems of time travel, either.The reality is Zhou has little interest in what most kids his age do. He would rather spend his time writing poetry or deep in thought, or on the practice ice trying to perfect his array of quadruple jumps.A lot of the pressure in skating does come from the outside, he said. There are fans who want to give you a standing ovation after skating a clean performance, there are people who expect you to improve and be a complete skater. Theres pressure coming from all sides. But the biggest source of pressure is from myself. Sometimes I dont show it on the outside, but Im a really ambitious person.That was evident in his quadfilled short program at the Pyeongchang Games.I always want to be the best, but I also do have a sense of realism, he said, and I know that winning the Olympics isnt really realistic. So its fortunate I dont have that pressure on myself. I cant imagine what its like for the people vying for the title. But I definitely want to put out two great performances and show people what Im capable of.It sounds cheesy, he added, but its true.American Vincent Zhou becomes first figure skater to land a quad lutz in the Olympics Japans Yuzuru Hanyu sets Olympic record in short program 2018 Winter Olympics: TV schedule and highlights Maggie Voisins final run not enough to capture slopestyle medal Nathan Chen dazzles after poor short program, finishes 5th overall Yuzuru Hanyu defends gold medal For Olympians in the quadrennial spotlight, social media can be an extreme sport Privacy Policy Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Figure Skating 2018 Winter Olympics
167 Gov. Bruce Rauner: Economic growth is in Illinois’ DNA http:ift.tt2nsTzZ5  Illinois boasts a brilliant legacy. It has 200 years of extraordinary accomplishments in its asset base and sets us up for an opportunity to build a truly remarkable future.It will take an uncommon level of collaboration to succeed but, as we have seen, big numbers can create a stampede of unity. Amazon brought together virtually every dissident faction in Illinois to construct a bid for a 15year, 168,000job project.The State of Illinois project is potentially just as lucrative. There is no question that we have what it takes to win the bid. The question is whether we have the will to put politics aside and roll up our sleeves to produce more jobs and better lives for the people of Illinois.Were ready for the challenge. The state has made remarkable strides in education. Weve transformed the funding formula and created funding parity for charter schools.People have already donated 45 million to our Invest in Kids tax credit scholarship program. The contributions will make it possible for children of lowerincome families to get into schools that meet their needs.The point is, we are taking the steps necessary to prepare our children to participate and prosper in the 21st century workforce.Our criminal justice reforms are aimed at joboriented outcomes, too. To be sure, there is simply no better crime deterrent than a goodpaying job. Were helping nonviolent, young offenders prepare for work after prison. The private sector is helping former offenders with apprenticeships and entrepreneur training.Along with a focus on jobs, we have been improving service to taxpayers. Weve cut fees for small business and our agencies have scissored through mountains of red tape. The idea is to get government out of the way so businesses can go to battle in the marketplace rather than fight city hall.Our tech initiatives are also helping us transform health delivery services and save us millions through Medicaid fraud detection and prevention. The dollars we are investing in these systems are paying off in greater efficiency and much better customer service. In fact, our technology initiatives are hastening response times and saving taxpayers millions of dollars.The seeds of growth have been planted. Well need the nurturing skills of one of our 72,000 farms to harvest the benefits. The heavy lifting will come when pension reform and taxes are on the agenda.The good news is we agree that pensions are out of control. They are bankrupting the state, and their unfunded liabilities are so high that retiree benefits are jeopardized. Most agree that we cannot sustain massive levels of pension spending.Many of us also agree that we cant tax our way out of trouble. Been there. Done that. Doesnt work. Property taxes, in particular, are pushing people out of house and home  and state. Time to stop sending our best people to Indiana and Wisconsin.This legislative session we need to overcome the politics and unite behind a jobs agenda. I am confident we can do it. It is in our DNA.Throughout its history, Illinois has been a magnet. If you wanted to till the soil, lay a brick, build a building, make a deal, supercompute, you name it  you could find work in Illinois, afford a home, and rely on the public schools to educate your children.In this Bicentennial year, we have an opportunity to turn yesterday into tomorrow, and make Illinois the powerhouse job creator it should be.Weve started the job. Today well be asking the people of Illinois and the legislature to help us finish it.Bruce Rauner is the governor of Illinois. He is scheduled to give his State of the State address at noon Wednesday.  
168 Agudath Israel of Illinois Lauds Bi-Partisan Solution to Scholarship Tax Credit Program Impasse On Friday, January 26, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner announced the adoption of a policy to include previously excluded schools in Illinois new tax credit scholarship program, the Invest in Kids Act. The breakthrough came after the Rauner administration, a bipartisan group of lawmakers, the Illinois State Board of Education ISBE, the Illinois Department of Revenue IDOR, and advocates including Agudath Israel of Illinois worked together to find an expedient way to include as many of these schools as possible without compromising the integrity of the program.The Invest in Kids Act was part of an historic bipartisan school funding bill signed in 2017 which included a 100 million scholarship tax credit program for low and middleincome families. Unfortunately, a provision in the law that requires schools to be recognized by ISBE, prevented 257 registered schools, many of which cater to disadvantaged children, from participating in the program. Since the most recent official list of recognized schools is from 2016, this provision excluded schools that applied for recognition but have not yet been approved, and even schools that are currently recognized, but not on ISBEs 2016 list. As a result, students who wished to attend highquality schools, including some Jewish schools, were not eligible to receive scholarships.After weeks of discussions between the aforementioned parties including Agudath Israel of Illinois AIOI, ISBE generated a new updated list of recognized schools that include all schools that were recognized in 2017 and allowed schools that have a recognition visit scheduled to provisionally participate pending the outcome of ISBEs visit.In a statement released by the Governors office, advocates, including AIOI, were acknowledged and Quote: d. Following discussions with stakeholders, a solution ensuring the participation of all schools that become recognized was achieved, said Rabbi Shlomo Soroka, AIOIs director of government affairs. Agudath Israel of Illinois thanks the Rauner Administration, the bipartisan group of legislators, the Illinois State Board of Education, the Illinois Department of Revenue, and advocates, who worked together to provide quality educational options to more students.

The company behind the cheesy chips said Tuesday that its not developing a line of Doritos designed specifically for women, despite widespread online speculation that it was.The phrase lady Doritos trended on social media after PepsiCos longtime CEO Indra Nooyi said on a podcast that unlike men, women dont like to lick their fingers after eating a bag of Doritos.Women would love to do the same, but they dont, Nooyi said in an interview on the Freakonomics podcast. They dont like to crunch too loudly in public. And they dont lick their fingers generously and they dont like to pour the little broken pieces and the flavor into their mouth.Nooyi, who has run the soda and snack company for more than a decade, later said the company is getting ready to launch snacks that are designed and packaged differently for women. Women love to carry a snack in their purse, Nooyi said.But PepsiCo said the interpretation of her comments to mean that femalefriendly Doritos were in the works were inaccurate.We already have Doritos for women  theyre called Doritos, the company said in a statement Tuesday.

He sees a lot of similar traits between himself and the 39yearold Nagy, whom he holds in high regard.Hes a great coach, the 32yearold McVay said of Nagy. Just watching his offense, especially the way he called those last six games, and then the offenses hes been a part of in Kansas City, really impressive. I know some people on that Chicago staff that have been really impressed with just what hes done already getting into that building. Very excited for coach Nagy.Despite his limited experience, McVay was hired at the age of 30 as the youngest coach in NFL history. He was the Redskins assistant tight ends coach in 2010 and led that group beginning in 2011. In 2014, McVay became the teams offensive coordinator, spending three years establishing Kirk Cousins as a starting quarterback.Ultimately, the Rams were drawn to McVay because of his extensive plans to develop young quarterback Jared Goff, the top pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. Goff was named Most Improved Player by the Professional Football Writers Association after his first season with McVay.The Bears are hoping that Nagy can develop Mitchell Trubisky, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, into a franchise quarterback like the Rams seem to have.Jareds always had a lot of confidence, McVay said. I know the rookie year didnt go the way we wanted it to go. But when you watch the way he responded, you never sensed he lost any confidence. He stayed the course, he got around some people where he could worry about what can he control, and thats the fundamentals, the techniques of the position, consistently delivering the ball with accuracy, and then just being himself.You knew why he was a No. 1 overall pick. I think you see a lot of the same things in Mitchell, why observers are excited about the future with him.In 2017, the Rams won the NFC West and finished 115, a year after going 412 and firing veteran coach Jeff Fisher. They had talented pieces on the roster under Fishers watch but couldnt put it all together, and the trouble started at the quarterback position with Goff.A major part of the success McVay enjoyed with the Rams last season came thanks to a strong coaching staff he built upon being hired. McVay looked to balance out his deficiencies as a young coach with the right supporting cast, including the respected Wade Phillips as defensive coordinator. He also retained John Fassel as special teams coordinator, overseeing the leagues best unit.Nagy constructed a wellrounded coaching staff that included retaining Vic Fangio as defensive coordinator, hiring former Oregon head coach Mark Helfrich as offensive coordinator and tabbing Chris Tabor to lead the special teams. He also landed an important hire in Harry Hiestand as offensive line coach.On several occasions, Nagy has stated that he will be leaning on the experience of his assistants.Its all about your coaching staff to start out, McVay said. We were able to build a mix of good veteran leadership and also some younger coaches that Ive gotten exposure to that are going to get an opportunity to run their own rooms and things like that. I think we had a good balance of veteran leadership with also some young players that are excited about positively pushing each other. Thats what we got on our coaching staff, and Im sure Nagy will do the same thing.The rookie season for McVay will be heralded for some time because his hiring by the Rams was considered surprising. It was the first head coaching interview he had received, and the natural thought was that he couldnt handle that role at such a young age.Instead, McVay led the Rams to new heights during his first year on the job and helped Goff establish himself with the potential hoped. The team eventually bowed out during the wildcard round and ended its revival with the disappointment that accompanies so many teams seasons.While McVay was crowned as the games best coach this past season, he remained grounded the whole time. Its why he believes in Nagys future with the Bears.You learn that you dont know everything, McVay said. Its always a consistent approach of trying to get better, listening and learning from everybody else, and then that will help you become a better leader. Its all about the people, and we got great people around.Chris Emma covers the Bears, Chicagos sports scene and more for 670 The Score 670TheScore.com.

Report: Derrick Rose Earning 11 Million From Adidas This Season Posted: 06 Feb 2018 09:45 AM PST670 The Score Despite little oncourt production, Derrick Rose is earning 11 million from Adidas this basketball season as part of the endorsement deal he signed with them back in 2012, Sports Illustrated reported .Rose signed a reported 14year, 185million deal with Adidas in February 2012, less than a year after he led the Bulls to the Eastern Conference finals and became the youngest MVP in NBA history at age 22. Rose received 12 million annually through the 201617 season, Sports Illustrated reported, in addition to annual royalties up to 6.25 million and annual appearance fees up to 4.8 million.Additionally, Roses brother Reggie, is is paid between 250,000 and 300,000 annually to serve as a consultant for Adidas, Sports Illustrated reported.Rose, 29, has played just 14 games this season, averaging 11.0 points per game, as hes once again dealt with injury problems, which first starkly surfaced when he tore his left ACL in the playoffs in April 2012. Rose has had four knee surgeries in all since that fateful moment that changed the trajectory of his career. Rose took a leave of absence from the Cavaliers in late November as he contemplated retirement, according to reports.Many endorsement contracts for professional athletes can include financial reduction language that provides protections for companies if the said athlete isnt healthy enough to play or if they dont perform to a certain level, but Roses contract included nullifying clauses for that so long as he made certain promotional appearances, Sports Illustrated reported.Former DNAinfo Chicago Staffers To Launch New Local News Site Posted: 06 Feb 2018 09:43 AM PSTCHICAGO CBS  Three months after the popular DNAinfo Chicago website was shut down, some of its former editors and staffers have teamed up to start a new subscriptionbased site to resume their focus on hyperlocal news.Editor in Chief Shamus Toomey and two other editors expect to launch Block Club Chicago in April, and already have reached their initial fundraising goal of 25,000. DNAinfo focused on extensive neighborhood news coverage not provided by larger news outlets from new restaurants and other businesses opening to crime, and from local school council issues to real estate developments.People like you let us know when we closed down that they felt value out of what we were doing. They missed us, Toomey said on the CBS 2 News at 11. We were providing sort of that neighborhood coverage that sometimes its harder to get from bigger stations, because well go to the community meetings, well go to the CAPS meetings, the Park District meetings in the neighborhoods. So the little stuff where some great news comes out.Block Club Chicago also has received startup funds from Civil, a blockchainbased platform supporting hyperlocal news operations across the U.S. Block Club Chicago plans to charge approximately 5 per month for subscriptions, and will run as a nonprofit.Along with Toomey, the operation will be led by fellow former DNAinfo editors Jen Sabella and Stephanie Lulay. It will be staffed by former DNAinfo reporters Kelly Bauer, Mauricio Pea, Alisa Hauser, and Mina Bloom former Chicago Defender and Chicago Crusader reporter Lee Edwards and a network of freelancers.Our reporters were really the lifeblood of the organization. They were night and day just really looking for a new story, Toomey said. So we decided maybe this is too good to just let go.Toomey acknowledged Block Club Chicago will be a bit smaller than DNAinfo at the beginning, but he hopes community support will help them quickly expand.Aldermen OK Outside Investigation Into Des Plaines Police Golf Outing Posted: 06 Feb 2018 09:18 AM PSTCHICAGO WBBM NEWSRADIO  Aldermen in Des Plaines have voted to spend up to 50,000 for an independent investigator to look into allegations of criminal misconduct during a police golf outing.This now makes three investigations into what occurred during the outing in Hoffman Estates last June. Police are conducting what theyre calling a criminal investigation.The investigations are looking into allegations of sexual assault involving an alleged female victim, who was then a police officer, at a party following the offduty golf outing.Ald. Malcolm Chester is among the city council members who sponsored the proposal about hiring an investigative firm. He says an outside firm is necessary because Hoffman Estates police are seeking evidence that could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas an internal probe may suggest corrective action or provide evidence in a lawsuit.Its my hope that the facts will come forward and we will find out a lot of these allegations prove not to be correct and that our police force acted appropriately, Chester said. Im hoping what well really see at the end of this is some sunshine.Des Plaines Police Chief Bill Kushner says there will also be an internal investigation.As Market Stagnates, Scott Boras Believes Abundance Of Rebuilding Teams Is A Cancer To Baseball Posted: 06 Feb 2018 09:09 AM PSTNEW YORK AP  Agent Scott Boras says the number of major league teams rebuilding with younger, lowercost rosters has become a cancer to the sport, attributing behavior to the strengthened luxury tax combining with restraints on draftpick salaries.Boras attributes baseballs attendance drop to an increase in noncompetitive teams, predicts fans from perennial losers will increasingly stay away from ballparks until ticket prices are cut and says regional sports networks will negotiate lower rights fees with teams going into rebuild cycles.J.D. Martinez, Mike Moustakas, Eric Hosmer and Jake Arrieta, all Boras clients, remain unsigned 10 days before spring training in a historically slow market. He says the luxury tax, envisioned by Commissioner Bud Selig to increase competitive balance, is having the opposite effect. He claims incentives are needed to winning, such as increasing draftpick money based on victories.They decided were going to have the 12 teamsatanking, if you will, and therefore youre got a noncompetitive cancer and this is completely opposite of what commissioner Selig in goodfaith sought in bargaining, Boras said Monday.Competitors watched a pair of successful rebuilds in the past two seasons. The Chicago Cubs won the 2016 World Series four years after losing 101 games and Houston took last years title four years after losing 111.Since 2012, baseballs collective bargaining agreement has limited the amount teams can spend on signing bonuses for amateur draft picks, making their cost predictable. Teams draft in reverse order of record, and clubs with higher selections are given larger amounts in their signingbonus pools.There is a number of teams, lets call it 10 or 12 in baseball, that are tearing down and rebuilding, Seattle general manager Jerry Dipoto said during the Mariners prespring training media availability on Jan. 25. You could argue that youre going to compete with more clubs to try to get the first pick in the draft than you would to win the World Series.Agent Brodie Van Wagenen suggested Friday that players consider boycotting spring training workouts, which start Feb. 14 but are not mandatory until Feb. 24. Dodgers closer Kenley Janson told Los Angeles reporters at the teams FanFest on Jan. 27 that maybe we have to go on strike, to be honest with you.Baseball has had labor peace since a 7 12month strike that caused the cancellation of the 1994 World Series. Under the labor contract covering 201721, the highest luxury tax rate was raised from 50 percent to 95 percent and penalties were added that could push back a highspending teams top draft pick or cause a loss of selections.The New York Yankees are intent of getting under the tax threshold for the first time after paying 341 million since the tax started in 2003. The Los Angeles Dodgers, who have led the major leagues in spending for the last four years, also are on track to get under this years 197 million threshold for what is formally known as the competitive balance tax.The restraint on the CBT grew, grew dramatically different than what was intended initially, Boras said. The intent was to create competition. The way the system is operating now, it is dramatically doing just the opposite. It is in affect creating competitive restraints where a third of the league is no longer competitive.Boras questioned why fans would want to pay the same price to attend games involving noncompetitive teams as they would to watch clubs trying to win.Where you have two tanking teams or one tanking team is in town to play a good team, theyre going to demand a reduction because the true MLB experience is no longer what it was professed to be, he said.Major league games averaged 30,042 fans last year, down 0.4 percent from 2016 and the lowest average since 2003.RSNs are going to start putting dynamics in their contracts, Boras said. You may see lawsuits where the RSNs are saying you in good faith promised us competitive performances. Youre not delivering that. Youre tanking. The audience knows youre not trying win.One of his solutions is to add money to a teams draft pool based on its wins and to punish teams with poorer records.If you win 78 games you get 2 million more in the draft, or if you win 80 games you get 4 or 6 or 8 or 10 as you go up the scale and you get 10 million in draft money if you wins 86 games, he said. You dont win more than 68 games, you dont get a topfive draft pick. And thats what every team is coveting to get, so they have a reason where they go, whoa, we cannot be that bad. We have to be that good.Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. Baffoe: Now What, Chicago Sports Fans Posted: 06 Feb 2018 08:56 AM PSTBy Tim Baffoe 670 The Score Has the anxiety that comes with a hangover set in yet Following a fantastic Super Bowl that saw the Philadelphia Eagles improbably outlast the New Patriots for the formers first title in franchise history, we here in Chicago are now left exhaling. And looking around us. And asking, Now what And becoming suddenly worried about the possible answers. One week from today, pitchers and catchers for the Cubs and White Sox report, the other side of the demarcation of the meteorological sports year that ends with the last NFL game. The TV shots of relievers stretching gives us a pleasant saccharine taste of warmer things to come and a conscious, fleeting attempt to force spring forward. But midFebruary is just a tease that real baseball is further away. The continuation of the established Cubs and the building White Sox cant yet fill the void we have here, even if regularseason games do start in late March.This sinking feeling of having so little Chicago sportswise to enjoy for now is very temporary and more a figment of the mind than anything dire, but it doesnt make it any less uncomfortable. The Super Bowl highlighted for us the conundrum that is the Chicago Bears, a team that may be trending upward, but who the hell really knows Sure, the announcement Saturday that former Bears middle linebacker Brian Urlacher had been elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame felt great and validating and fitting the franchises positional stereotype of George and Butkus and Singletary. If history says that, I guess Im a part of that category now, Urlacher said . Its a great honor to be associated with the Hall of Fame and now to be in it. Its awesome. This experience has been very cool for me. Very humbling.So cool. But the Bears of today are still in flux. Will Mitchell Trubisky become anything like Nick Foles or Carson Wentz have been for the Eagles Is new 39yearold head coach Matt Nagy the next sideline phenom or another in a streak of badtouninspiring that weve dealt with for the better part of three decadesAndy Reid told me that Matt Nagy is the best headcoaching candidate hes ever had, NFL.coms Adam Caplan podcast in November . He told me that at the owners meetings. I just happened to ask him who some candidates are on his roster of coaches and he loves Matt Nagy, who he had in Philly.Thats a great endorsement when you consider Nagy joins five other of Reids assistants as current head coaches in the NFL and will have former head coach Brad Childress help, as the Bears hired him as an offensive consultant Monday . But is the current state of the Bears following the psycheandsoul drainings of the Trestman and Fox eras the stuff of the glasses half fullThe NFL draft is months away and the next Bears game much more distant, though. In the meantime, there are the Blackhawks and Bulls, if youre into that. The championship window on the ice closed fast and hard this season, with the Blackhawks as of Monday holding a mere 15 percent chance of making the Stanley Cup playoffs . This is a team that had the most points in the Western Conference last season.We still got a lot of time left, coach Joel Quenneville said over the weekend . But I dont think you want to look any further than one game and trying to capture some momentum. Trying to get some consistency for a 60minute game, that, to me would be some nice momentum.Not exactly inspiring. Goalie Corey Crawford, who last played in a game on Dec. 23, was back on the ice working out the past three days, which gives a glimmer of hope of salvaging the season, but his return to gameplay is, well, as clear as any NHL injury update.Thatd be optimistic, days, Quenneville said of how far away Crawford is from wearing a game sweater. And when I say days, the fact hes on the ice, I dont think itll be too far away, once hes practicing with us, that hed be able to play. The Bulls are  entertaining But Nikola Mirotic is now traded, and others may follow between now and Thursdays trade deadline. The players best effort to defy the tank has proved futile, as theyve lost seven in a row, including to the otherwisetankingharder Sacramento Kings in a spectacular battle of the tanking wills Monday night.The Bulls have the leagues sixthworst record, but they have the moxie to sink lower and are only two games out of the leagues bottom spot. That whole Hey, the Bulls are overachieving scare has gone away thankfully, and draft lottery thoughts become a big ol warm afghan for the time being.So it seems we have a few months of whatifs across the Chicago sports board to fill the now what until baseball. It feels icky in the stomach, but at least it doesnt last.Tim Baffoe is a columnist for 670TheScore.com. Follow Tim on Twitter @TimBaffoe .

Researchers are now hoping their experiments lead to a vaccine for human cancer patients.The new treatment, which was directly injected into the tumor sites of 90 mice, cured 87 mice of the disease. Stanfords formula contains two immunestimulating agents which were so effective they eliminated the tumors they were injected into as well as reduced the tumors in untreated parts of the mice. The three subjects that relapsed were given a second shot of the new treatment which cleared up the tumors again.When we use these two agents together, we see the elimination of tumors all over the body, Dr. Ronald Levy, professor of oncology said in a university release . Our approach uses a onetime application of very small amounts of two agents to stimulate the immune cells only within the tumor itself. In the mice, we saw amazing, bodywide effects.Levy and his team add that the new treatment could create a fast and inexpensive way to eliminate cancer. Compared to standard treatments which try to stimulate the entire bodys immune system at once and raises costs, the Stanford vaccine only delivers a small amount of medication to a specific tumor area.The next step for the scientists is a small trial with 15 people who have been diagnosed with lowgrade lymphoma. If the injections are successful, Dr. Levy says the treatment could one day eliminate the need for the surgical removal of all kinds of tumors. I dont think theres a limit to the type of tumor we could potentially treat, as long as it has been infiltrated by the immune system.Trump: Disgraceful That Man Illegally In U.S. Killed Edwin Jackson Posted: 06 Feb 2018 08:25 AM PSTCBSAP  President Donald Trump says its so disgraceful that Indianapolis Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson was killed by a person who is in the U.S. illegally.Trump tweeted Tuesday: So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson.

Their car was pulled over on the side of Interstate 70 because Jackson felt sick. Both men were outside the vehicle when a black Ford F150 truck plowed into them. The force of the impact threw one of the men into the center lane where he was later accidentally struck by a state police vehicle. The driver, Manuel OrregoSavala, is a Guatemalan citizen and was deported from the U.S. twice, according to police.OrregoSavala, was arrested with a blood alcohol level nearly three times the legal limit. According to a police affidavit, the suspect used an alias  and was in the country illegally. Investigators say he was deported to Guatemala in 2007 and again in 2009.

But then the Bulls found a rhythm.Robin Lopez got tossed after two technicals, putting Cristiano Felicio into action. Zach LaVine started facing double teams and all that was left were mostly contested shots late in possessions. The Kings closed with a 6343 advantage in the second half, and the Bulls work was done. They now stand just two games out of the leagues worst record after seven straight defeats, just ahead of the Hawks.And more trades than just Niko Mirotic are likely before Thursdays deadline, with Lopez on the block along with Jerian Grant, Justin Holiday and others. Kris Dunn is well advised to take his time in returning from concussion, and Lauri Markkanen missed the game while being a part of the birth of his son.Its all working out, with two firstplace opponents up next in the Timberwolves and regrouped Wizards.Dan Bernstein is a cohost of 670 The Scores Bernstein and Goff Show in afternoon drive .

Report: Temptations Singer Dennis Edwards Abused Weeks Before Death Posted: 06 Feb 2018 06:32 AM PSTCHICAGO CBS  Chicago police were investigating an allegation of domestic abuse filed just weeks before former Temptations lead singer Dennis Edwards died.Edwards, 74, died Thursday night at Mercy Hospital. He had been ill for months. He had suffered a stroke last year in St. Louis, and had come to Chicago for rehab.Dennis Edwards and The Temptations performs during the Jazz A Vienne festival on July 8, 2013 in Vienne, France. Credit: David RedfernRedferns via Getty ImagesPolice said its unclear if Edwards death was connected to a domestic violence allegation filed last month. The report was filed on Jan 8, and alleged Edwards was the victim of domestic violence in December.Investigators were waiting for a full autopsy report from the Cook County Medical Examiners office.The St. Louis PostDispatch reports an investigator with the Healthcare Consortium of Illinois filed a request for an order of protection on Edwards behalf on Jan. 12. The request accuses Edwards wife, Brenda, tried to suffocate him by holding his head facedown on a bed. According to the PostDispatch, the protection order request claimed Edwards was bed bound and immobile.The PostDispatch reports an emergency protective order against Edwards wife was granted on Jan. 18, barring her from contact with him. He reportedly was removed from their home in Chicago because of medical issues.Elderly Couple Dead In West Garfield Park Fire Posted: 06 Feb 2018 05:13 AM PSTCHICAGO CBS  An elderly man and woman considered fixtures in their community were found dead in a burning apartment building Tuesday morning in the West Garfield Park neighborhood.Around 3:15 a.m., the Fire Department responded to a blaze at a twostory apartment building near Pulaski and Wilcox.When firefighters entered the building, they found an elderly man and a woman unresponsive in the upstairs apartment. Aldonia and Louis White, both 90, were pronounced dead at the scene.Aldonia and Louis White Photo supplied to CBSDeputy District Chief Chuck Maes said the fire appears to have started in the Whites kitchen area, where Aldonia was found dead. Her husband was found in the dining roomliving room area.Possibly, if there was working smoke detectors, it could have alerted them at the time, and they could have got out of the building before the fire escalated, he said.Fire Department Deputy District Chief Jack Nagle said there were smoke detectors in the building, but they werent working.Every time we have one of these tragedies, it seems to be the same thing. Theres either no smoke detectors, or theres no batteries in there, and too soon to tell if it would have made a difference here, but generally its always a possibility, Deputy District Chief Jack Nagle said. A Fire Department spokesman said, based on evidence found at the scene, the fire might be suspicious. The Police Bomb and Arson Unit was investigating the cause of the fire.Witnesses said they saw the blaze before the Fire Department arrived, and tried to help the elderly couple, but couldnt.We saw the fire through the gangway. It was busting the window through the gangway, and the fire was getting real big, Marcus Johnson said. We tried to help them. We tried to get inside, but we couldnt do nothing.Bernetta Sigler, who served as the couples caretaker for the past four years, said when she left the home Monday night, the Whites were doing well. Im just pretty devastated. Its unbelievable, she said. They were great, loving people.Sigler said Louis White was a military veteran who was no longer able to walk on his own. Neighbors said that would have made it difficult for him to escape the secondfloor unit.Despite his disability, Sigler said he never lost his sense of humor.Mr. White, he was always cracking jokes, and just being funny, and loved to sing, she said.Aldonia White was a retired nurse who went from caring for patients to her husband, and in some sense the neighborhood.Mrs. White, she was always strong about kids getting education and staying off the streets, and just wanted everybody just to be good people, Sigler said.Firefighters returned to the block around 10 a.m. to hand out free smoke detectors. Its something the department does after most fatal fires, in the hopes of driving home the point that 60 percent of fatal home fires happen in buildings with no smoke alarms or nonfunctional smoke alarms. Gregg: Ice Dancing  Choctaws, Mohawks, And More Posted: 06 Feb 2018 05:00 AM PSTIn preparation for the upcoming Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, WBBMs Rick Gregg spoke with experts in each of four sports in a series of interviews for WBBMNewsradio.com. Today: Collin Brubaker, a former Team USA Ice Dancer and National Medalist who is now a skating coach in the western suburbs. CHICAGO WBBM NEWSRADIO  Collin Brubaker and his partner, Alissandra Aronow, finished in ninth place in the ice dancing competition at the US Figure Skating Championships in 2014. Thats an impressive finishThe champions and future gold medalists, Meryl Davis and Charlie White, nearly doubled Brubaker and Aronows score.They were in a league of their own, Brubaker said. It wasnt an uncommon thing for them to blow people out of the water by 30, 40, 50 points.ST PAUL, MN  JANUARY 22: Alissandra Aronow and Collin Brubaker compete in the Short Dance at the 2016 Prudential U.S. Figure Skating Championship on January 22, 2016 at Xcel Energy Center in St Paul, Minnesota. Photo by Hannah FoslienGetty ImagesThey are gone from competition now, but Brubaker learned quite a bit from pairing with the two. Lessons he applies as a coach, in the western suburbs.They found a way to make the most of everything, and not give up any points, he said. If you lose a half a point here, and one point there, by doing something silly, by making mental errors, by not holding a position long enough or having just a little slip of an edgetheres just a small margin for error.Competitive ice dancers are nearly always paired for years, and challenge number one is putting a pair together. Both skaters have to be able to tolerate the ups and downs of their other half  nearly every hour of every day.Collin Brubaker photo provided to WBBMYou spend so much time together, Brubaker said  up to eight hours a day, five days a week. You endure the journey of these ups and downs together. Youre pushing your body to the limits, day in and day out. Doing that with a personthat adds something extra. Im not doing pushups by myself, someones sitting on my back while Im doing pushups. Its one of those. But you have to say.even when Im tired, Im in a bad mood, I dont feel good, we have a common goal. I have a responsibility. Professionalism is a huge thing.Brubaker also said longevity of a pair is extremely important, and thats a good thing for Team USA. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th place finishers at Nationals in 2014, finished 1st, 2nd and 3rd in 2018, and will represent the US in South Korea.BOSTON, MA  JANUARY 11: Alissandra Aronow and Collin Brubaker skate in the free dance program during the 2014 Prudential U.S. Figure Skating Championships at TD Garden on January 11, 2014 in Boston, Massachusetts. Photo by Jared WickerhamGetty ImagesAs for Brubaker, hes hoping to develop the next class of ice dance champions.One of the first things that Im looking for is that type of spirit, or big personality that comes out in a skater, he said. Because in dance, theres no comfort zone where you cant be afraid to push the boundaries. You have to explore all options with dance. And to a certain degree, especially from a guy standpoint, you have to have this sense of confidence about you. There is almost a certain degree of arrogance, because you have to look like you know exactly what youre doing. And thats what were trying to sell or portray to the judges. Were selling our performance and the product that weve brought to the ice. That comes with energy, and attitude, and personality.Autistic Whitney Young Senior Who Was Killed Always Had A Smile On His Face Posted: 06 Feb 2018 04:14 AM PSTCHICAGO CBS  Faculty and students at Whitney Young High School on Monday were mourning the loss of a popular special needs student who was stabbed to death at his temporary apartment in the East Garfield Park neighborhood on the West Side.Brandon PorterYoung was a handsome, quiet 18yearold senior who loved playing basketball and gardening, according to a peer and members of the Whitney Young staff.Principal Joyce Dorsey Kenner recalled that the autistic student always had a smile on his face.Brandon PorterYoung Source: Whitney Young High SchoolKenner said PorterYoung, who had a severe learning disability and a profound issue with intellectual capacity, was home alone at the time of his death Friday night.

Dont worry, Dar, you got my half of my pension and youll have Social Security, and youll be able to make ends meet.But Groth had serious problems after she applied for survivors benefits from Social Security last August. She was told the money would arrive in 30 to 45 days, but it didnt.Groth called and came to the Social Security offices in Waukegan multiple times to find out what was going on with her benefits.They said, Well, youre probably being processed, so itll take a little while, Groth says. This is something Im entitled to and your continually telling me Im being processed.During another visit months later, she says another employee told her, Oh my goodness, you must have fallen between the cracks.He said, Watch me, Im going on the computer right now and Im going to make you a priority and I can assure you that within 30 to 45 days youll see that check, Groth says.No dice.I was up the creek without a paddle until I called you, Groth adds.Within days after the 2 Investigators called the Social Security Administration, the sum of 4,594 was deposited in her bank account for benefits due back to August. Her 1,648 benefit check is set to arrive this month.Groth says she was amazed at the quick resolution.A Social Security spokesperson says the normal processing time is about two weeks and Groths fivemonth delay was due to an oversight by an employee. He did not answer questions about exactly what the oversight was, adding they are unaware of any similar complaintsI think this is actually quite common, counters Lawrence Kotlikoff, Professor of Economics at Boston University.Kotlikoff, an outspoken, critic of the Social Security Administration, says deathbenefit payment delays can be a nightmare for grieving spouses.This has to be fixed, Kotlikoff said. Its the right thing to do, and Social Security is an organization that has to be fixed from the bottom up.At least Darlene Groth is now getting her money.You really came through for me and I cant thank you enough, she says.The agency spokesperson also apologized for the inconvenience and said Social Security does everything possible to process widows claims quickly.Analysts: Dow Plunge Not Cause For Panic, Yet Posted: 05 Feb 2018 08:15 PM PSTCBS  Mondays stock market plunge comes on the heels of a big drop Friday.It wasnt a dip. It was a dive.When trading ended, the Dow Jones had dropped more than 1,100 points.The drop, combined with Fridays 600plus decline, equals a 7 percent loss for the Dow.So, why is it happeningThe concern seems to be about inflation getting higher and that higher inflation means the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, says Morningstar.com Editor Jeremy Glaser.That could slow the economy. But Glaser, like other experts, says perspective is key.The market is still way up since it began its climb almost nine years ago.Its not a sign the economy is falling apart. Its not a sign that there should be panic, Glaser says.And its nothing like Black Monday, 1987s 25 percent market drop, or the crash 10 years ago. What it does mean for the 54 percent of Americans invested in the stock market is they may want to stop and reevaluate investments, opting for safer vehicles.If you need your money within a year, get that money out of risk assets. It never should have been there to begin with, says CBS News Business Analyst Jill Schlesinger.

The Best Video Platforms For Your Small Business Posted: 05 Feb 2018 05:00 PM PST Regardless of industry, scale or location, if you are a small business owner you need to be promoting your company with branded videos. As this Forbes article explains, almost half of internet users watch a video related to a product or service before making a purchase. 64 percent of consumers make a purchase after watching a branded social video. With that level of impact, its importance as a promotional tool cant be understated. Here is a rundown of the best video platforms you can use to introduce your company to the world. YouTube With more than 1 billion active users, YouTube is the largest videosharing platform on Earth. If you want to showcase your brand to as many consumers as possible, YouTube is the way to go. Its benefits include an unlimited quantity of highquality video content uploads, robust analytics, and a userfriendly interface. Its popularity among mobile users and the ability to add interactive calltoaction messages at the end of a video are also key features. Google owns YouTube so if you already have a Google account for your business, youre already connected to an entire digital ecosystem, with support.The biggest drawback of using YouTube is that because of its size, your companys ads will have a hard time standing out in an ocean of content. Additionally, its an adsupported platform and users dont get a say in the content of the ads, which may be competitive or even offensive to your business. Vimeo Vimeo is a videosharing platform that made its name by being the first website of its type to host high definition clips in 2007. Today, its better known for cultivating a thriving community of talented content creators that attracts 170 million active monthly viewers. Positive aspects of Vimeo are that its an adfree platform, features embeddable player customization and indepth analytics. It also has a premium account option that includes email capture and video production support. Conversely, it has a smaller active viewer base than YouTube and has limitations on the number of videos users can upload. It also charges businesses a minimum 120 a year to host content. Facebook Although its primary function is not a video platform, there are a few good reasons to host some of your companys promotional clips on the worlds largest social network. Facebook s extensive data mining allows small business owners to specifically target their videos to users who will be most receptive to their message. A recent study found that native Facebook videos get shared 10 times more often than YouTube clips and cost less per 1,000 impressions .Its biggest drawbacks are its algorithms, which effectively will bury videos that dont resonate with users and counts threesecond plays as a view. Also, the fact that Facebook isnt seen as a premier content hub means that it currently functions better as a secondary video advertising channel. Animoto Animoto is an ideal platform for small business owners who dont have much experience working with video. The reason is that its also a videocreation platform that gives users access to a host of editing tools, thousands of commercially licensed songs and more than 100 prefabricated video styles. With those features, owners who know nothing about making videos can create quality clips that will appeal to consumers. Its only real problem is that because of its relatively small user base, Animotos is currently most useful as a videocreation site rather than a hosting platform.

Scientists say that a chemical used in the cooking of the fast food chains french fries may hold the cure for baldness.Researchers at Yokohama National University found that the chemical dimethylpolysiloxane  found in silicone and added to cooking oil as an antifoaming agent  helped to mass produce hair follicles which grew new hair after being placed into mice. According to the findings, published in the journal Biomaterials , Japanese scientists were able to generate nearly 5,000 hair follicle germs HFG which the team said is one of the biggest obstacles in creating hair regenerative medicine.We used oxygenpermeable dimethylpolysiloxane at the bottom of culture vessel, and it worked very well, Professor Junji Fukuda said in a press release . Working with the modified french frycooking ingredient, researchers created HFG chips which carried batches of the new follicles and implanted them into the mice. The chips, transplanted into the backs and scalps of the subjects, reportedly began to grow new black hair from each patch.This simple method is very robust and promising. We hope that this technique will improve human hair regenerative therapy to treat hair loss, Fukuda added.Rep. Jeanne Ives Defends Controversial Campaign Ad Posted: 05 Feb 2018 01:28 PM PSTCHICAGO CBS  Republican State Rep. Jeanne Ives is refusing to take down a controversial campaign ad, despite many denouncing it as offensive and divisive.Now I know there are people here chomping at the bit to chomp me to bits, Ives said at a City Club of Chicago luncheon Monday, where she arrived expecting to defend her commercial against incumbent Gov. Bruce Rauner.The commercial that is generating the expected hysteria from the expected quarters attempted to do, admittedly provocatively, was to properly and truthfully characterize the extreme issue positions Rauner took and their implications. twill ilrevolution  Jeanne Ives @JeanneIves February 5, 2018 The ad shows depictions of constituencies Ives says Rauner has helped, including undocumented immigrants, transgender people and Chicago teachers. As a result, various interest groups are now thanking the governor for standing up for them.Thank you for making all Illinois families pay for my abortions. Thank you for signing legislation that lets me use the girls bathroom, the ad says.Ives says she doesnt know why people are upset, saying, I want to know why people are so offended by it The commercial does not attack people, it tackles issues by truthfully illustrating the constituencies Rauner has chosen to serve to the exclusion of others.Still, she admits the commercial was provocative.State GOP Chairman Tim Schneider said she needs to pull down the ad, and apologize to those who were negatively portrayed in a cowardly attempt to stoke political division.Ives maintains the ad focuses on policy, and is not meant to be offensive to any person or group.Over the weekend, Ives received an additional 2 million donation from conservative businessman Richard Uihlein, who gave her 500,000 last week. Her consultant, Dan Proft, says that money will enable Ives to introduce herself to voters and expose Rauners record through TV ads.Pharmacies Experiencing Flu Vaccine, Tamiflu Shortage Posted: 05 Feb 2018 12:30 PM PSTCHICAGO CBS  The severe flu outbreak gripping Chicago and the rest of the country has doctors urging everyone to get their flu shot.

By DON BABWINAssociated Press CHICAGO AP  A police commander who was killed after a foot chase in downtown Chicago was shot in the head by a suspect carrying a semiautomatic handgun equipped with an extended clip of ammunition, a police official told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The official, who was briefed on the investigation, spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to provide such details until charges are filed against the suspect in the death of Cmdr. Paul Bauer. Bauer, who had been on the police force for 31 years, was shot Tuesday afternoon after spotting a man matching the radio description of an armed suspect, Chicago police have said. The official told the AP that Bauer, 53, had identified himself as a police officer and was trying to trying to detain the suspect when they got into a physical fight and fell down a stairwell that led to a locked underground walkway. Police spokesman Frank Giancamilli would not comment on the weapon but said the suspect was wearing a bulletproof vest under a heavy coat when he was arrested. The Chicago Police Department has said tactical officers had detained the suspect outside the James R. Thompson Center government building when the man fled. Officers initially confronted the suspect because he was acting suspiciously, according to police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. Some initial media reports said the suspect may have been involved in the robbery of a local business, but Johnson did not provide details about what the man was doing that prompted officers to want to speak with him. Officers had been chasing the man on foot when Bauer saw the offender and engaged in an armed physical confrontation, Johnson said Tuesday afternoon. Police captured the suspect a short time later, and a gun was recovered at the scene, he said. I just ask the citizens of this city to keep the Bauer family in their prayers, said Johnson, who choked back tears as he spoke to reporters outside the hospital where Bauer had been pronounced dead. It was initially reported that Bauer was off duty, but police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter late Tuesday that Bauer was on duty. He said in an email Wednesday that it was a chaotic scene and Bauer had been attending training at the Chicago Fire Department with other officials before the shooting. There was no communication from him on the radio informing dispatch that he was in pursuit of the offender or that he was even on scene, so they initially thought it was an offduty officer until someone recognized him, Guglielmi wrote. Mayor Rahm Emanuel called Bauers death a tragic reminder of the dangerous duty the men and women of our police department accept to ensure the safety of us all. Noreen Danko was on her way to her office nearby when she heard the gunshots. I was walking down the street and I heard pop pop pop pop pop, Danko told the Chicago Tribune. And I said to the girl next to me, Is that what I think it is And she said, Yep. I said, Aw geez. And everybody is scurrying all over and I see the police head to the stairs there. She said she saw officers lead the shackled suspect away and put him in a squad car, then watched as emergency workers administered CPR to Bauer, who was lying on a stretcher, before he was put inside an ambulance and rushed to the hospital. ___ This story has been corrected to indicate that the commander was on duty, not off duty, based on updated information from police.

AP PhotoRick Danzl By JAMES BOYD Associated Press CHAMPAIGN, Ill. AP  Close games have not gone well for Illinois this season. The Illini have lost nine games by single digits, including three losses in overtime and one at the buzzer against Nebraska on Jan. 15. But in a rematch Sunday afternoon, the Illini got their revenge in a 7266 victory over the Cornhuskers, powered by Leron Black. Black poured in a careerhigh 28 points and snagged seven rebounds to help Illinois outlast Nebraska. He scored 17 points in 12 minutes in the first half, including a stretch in which he made seven consecutive field goals. My teammates were finding me in all the right spots, Black said. I had a lot of open shots. They were looking for me and getting me the ball. There were six ties and nine lead changes during the game, but the deciding basket came from Black. He nailed a turnaround, fadeaway jumper with two minutes left that put the Illini ahead by three and brought the State Farm Center crowd to its feet. On the Illinis final two possessions Trent Frazier and Mark Smith knocked down four free throws to secure the win. Illinois 1315, 312 Big Ten shot 62 percent from the field and made 7 of 9 from behind the arc to outscore Nebraska 4336 in the first half. But after the break, the Cornhuskers used a 164 run to climb back in it for a fivepoint lead. The teams traded baskets the rest of the way, but Black proved to be too much. He knocked down 3 of 5 from behind the arc in his second consecutive 20point performance. Huge night from Leron, coach Brad Underwood said. Everyone got to see how his game has expanded. He shot a couple off the dribble today, he hit a couple threes. Really pleased with the way he played. Frazier and Kipper Nichols were the only other Illini to score in double figures, finishing with 12 points apiece. Isaac Copeland led the way with 17 points for Nebraska 209, 115, who lost for the just the second time in its past 10 games. We had just kind of gone to sleep in the first half, coach Tim Miles. We hadnt practiced that great coming in and we played that way. BIG PICTURE Glynn Watson Jr., Nebraskas third leading scorer, finished with just three points on 1of9 shooting. The loss snapped the Cornhuskers sixgame winning streak. Illinois slight win should give Underwoods young squad some confidence moving forward as it prepares to close out the regular season. INJURED STARTER Michael Finke missed his third consecutive game with a concussion. The Illinois forward has started in 25 games this season and is the Illinis fourth leading scorer at 9.6 points per game. FRESHMAN HISTORY Frazier has scored in doublefigures in 16 of Illinois last 18 games. Hes averaging 12.3 points this year which is the most by an Illini freshman since Dee Brown during the 200203 season. QUOTABLE You talk about having pride You talk about feeling good Thats everything we have to be about, Underwood said regarding a loose ball scrum in the second half. That was three, four guys on the floor all fighting to win a game. Didnt care about a little burn from the floor, didnt care about getting knocked. Tonight I knew we were in good shape when we were to that point because that is selfless. That was the play of the night in my opinion. UP NEXT Nebraska returns home to take on Indiana. The Hoosiers are led by Juwan Morgan, who is ranked eighth in the Big Ten in scoring at 16.6 points per game. Illinois will hit the road and face Michigan State on Tuesday. The No. 2 Spartans have a 10game winning streak.

176 Max Strus stayed close to home to give DePaul a long-range shooting threat - Chicago Tribune Things went so well for Max Strus on a recruiting trip to Xavier that his parents figured the process was over.We told Max that he didnt have to make the visit to DePaul, said Debra Strus, Maxs mother.But not even Mom and Dad realized how much staying close to home meant to a player known for his long range.That was important to me, said Max, a Stagg High School graduate.DePaul coach Dave Leitao sensed that familyfirst vibe when Strus officially received his release from Division II Lewis University after two outstanding seasons that included a 52point game. So DePauls successful pitch stressed how Strus could lean on his support system in the southwest suburbs during a long, occasionally lonely season he had to sit out under NCAA transfer rules. None of the other programs in pursuit  besides Xavier, Strus also considered Butler, Louisville and Oregon  could beat DePauls geography.Heredity also favored the Blue Demons. DePaul inducted Debra Strus, nee Brinkman, a volleyball and basketball player from 1977 to 1981, into the schools Athletics Hall of Fame when Max was a little boy.But I didnt want to push DePaul at all, Debra said. He had to feel comfortable.It didnt take long for the guy whose goal always was to play Division I basketball to find a comfort zone.After about a week of practice, I took him aside and said I thought he should readjust his expectations because he could go as high as he wanted to dream, Leitao recalled. He has an ability to absorb and understand people, an insatiable work ethic. And, of course, the ease with which he shoots.As natural as the shooting stroke looks for the 6foot6 Strus, basketball happened almost accidentally. The erstwhile quarterback quit football his freshman year after breaking his collarbone for the second time in five years  both injuries oddly occurring on the same day, Oct. 16. The former pitcher considered a college career like his dad, John, a former Eastern Illinois pitcher, but his fondness for basketball grew as he did.A late bloomer at Stagg who was only 59 as a sophomore, Strus received only one scholarship offer, from Chicago State, after his prep career. He landed at Lewis, a respected Division II program in Romeoville where his older brother, Marty, played. In two seasons, Strus dominated, averaging 16.8 points, earning AllAmerica honors and enjoying one of those nights he will relive long after his last shot.Chris Sweda  Chicago Tribune DePauls Max Strus runs down the court at Wintrust Arena on Nov. 11, 2017. DePauls Max Strus runs down the court at Wintrust Arena on Nov. 11, 2017. Chris Sweda  Chicago Tribune It came Nov. 24, 2015, at Midland, Mich., in front of only 385 fans inside Northwood Universitys gymnasium. Strus felt a knot in his neck pregame that made him feel tight. During warmups, he missed more shots than he made.But then my first one went down in the game and the rest was surreal, he recalled.He hit 14 of 18 fieldgoal attempts in a 9995 victory, including 12 3pointers, and all 12 free throws. More importantly, he made an indelible impression in the minds of anybody who saw a videotape of his 52point performance  a Max effort indeed.It was his athleticism as much as his skill, Leitao recalled. No matter who youre playing against, 12 3s is 12 3s.Word spread quickly. Occasionally, his mind wandered. After Lewis lost its final NCAA tournament game in Somers, Wis., Strus discussed his future at dinner with his parents. John Strus trusted the opinion of good friend Jack Fitzgerald, the longtime Richards coach and NBA scout who saw potential for Max to do more on a bigger stage.We said to Max, If you want to do this, were behind you,  John recalled.The toughest conversation involved telling Lewis coach Scott Trost, for whom Strus started 64 games. Trost understood and after Lewis officially granted Strus his release, a flood of Division I coaches called within three hours.I decided to chase my dreams, Strus said.The reality that Strus found his level comes every time he puts on No. 31 for DePaul, which he leads in scoring at 18.2 points heading into Wednesdays game at Georgetown. Hitting 36 percent from 3point range, Strus exploded for 33 against Xavier and Northwestern and scored 27 Saturday against Butler. For the NBA, Strus will need to develop a stronger midrange game. But for DePaul, the junior easily has been the most consistent player for a rebuilding 811 team. Big East defenses have tried anything and everything to harass Strus, who is humble but not shy.If my shot is going, Im pretty hard to guard, Strus said.The pride can be pretty hard to process for his parents, who attend every DePaul game. Maxs brother, Marty, is in his first year as Stagg boys basketball coach. His sister, Maggie, who played volleyball at UIC, just joined the DePaul volleyball staff. Grandparents John Sr., 95, and Mary Jane, 90, still crack a smile reading about their grandson in the sports section. John Strus used the word overwhelming to describe the familys emotions.A couple years ago, Im driving to a Lewis game at Truman State in Kirksville Missouri, where theres one hotel and today I booked for the Big East tournament at Madison Square Garden, John said.It isnt Times Square, but a DePaul billboard on East Jackson features Strus dunking alongside the words Sweet Home Court Chicago. The campus bookstore should consider giving away Strus On The Loose Tshirts to students. Maybe the ticket office can pick up the tab.Before the DePaulNotre Dame game at Wintrust Arena, John Strus says he reserved 200 tickets for family and friends. For DePaulVillanova it was 150.Ive got relatives I didnt know I had, he said.And apparently, they can recruit.dhaugh@chicagotribune.comTwitter @DavidHaughTom Crean, now with ESPN, on a year of transitions: Ive never lost the drive to coach Jack Hoiberg, son of Bulls coach, hopes to make his own name at Michigan State Brad Underwood fighting for culture after Illini fall to 08 in Big Ten Fourstar DePaul to announce college choice today College Basketball Coaches College Sports DePaul Blue Demons Basketball NBA Big East Conference

178 Mekowulu lifts Tennessee State past Eastern Illinois 50-47 Mekowulu lifts Tennessee State past Eastern Illinois 5047 10 hrs ago NASHVILLE, Tenn. AP  Christian Mekowulu scored a careerhigh 27 points and hauled in 10 rebounds to lift Tennessee State to a 5047 win over Eastern Illinois on Saturday night. In a tight game where neither team led by more than five points, Tennessee State 1011, 55 Ohio Valley Conference got a pair of free throws followed by a 3point play from Mekowulu to edge back on top 4945 with 47 seconds remaining. Montell Goodwin sliced the deficit back to two on a jumper at the other end before Mekowulu dropped in another free throw with seven seconds left and Ray Crossland missed a potentially gametying 3pointer just ahead of the buzzer. Mekowulu finished 8 of 14 from the field and missed just four of his 15 free throws to secure the season sweep over Eastern Illinois. Eastern Illinois 714, 37 shot just 29 percent from the field.

By SOPHIA TAREEN and DON BABWINAssociated Press CHICAGO AP  Five years after the largest mass closure of public schools in an American city, Chicago is forging ahead with a plan to shutter four more in one of the citys highestcrime and most impoverished areas. School officials are pitching the new closures around Englewood, a neighborhood on Chicagos South Side, to make way for a new 85 million school they insist will better serve students and reverse low enrollment. But some parents, students and activists are skeptical, saying theyre still reeling from the 2013 closures and the latest plan will make things worse, including the displacement of hundreds of mostly black and poor teenagers. The last thing they should do is close our schools, said 16yearold Miracle Boyd, a student at John Hope College Prep, which could close. They arent the ones sitting in those chairs five days a week struggling to learn because we dont have the necessities we need as students. ... Why not use the 85 million to improve our education and get our schools on the road to success Like other cities, Chicago has long relied on closures to address underperforming and underutilized schools. Significant closures have taken place in Philadelphia, Detroit and St. Louis, but Chicago made history when it closed roughly 50 schools, affecting more than 12,000 students in mostly AfricanAmerican and Latino neighborhoods. The debate over Chicagos latest proposed closures has exploded, with shouting matches and emotional pleas during community meetings. Residents have pleaded with the district to invest more in neighborhood schools and safety. Some have alleged that racial politics are at play. And they worry by pulling students out of schools near their homes and placing them in ones farther away, they are putting them in danger of gang members who will view them as the enemy just by virtue of their address. Chicago Public Schools says nothing is final until an expected Feb. 28 board vote. The nations thirdlargest school district argues its tried to boost enrollment and resources to the four schools, but it hasnt helped. The changes coincide with a major drop in black residents. Roughly 180,000 people moved from Chicago from 2000 to 2010, according to census data. In Englewood, about 10 miles from downtown, fewer than 500 students are enrolled in the four schools. As a result, one freshmen class has only 17 students and another school doesnt offer science. We have to move these kids. They dont have enough support in these buildings, schools chief Janice Jackson said. We cant sit by and continue to watch people leave. The new school, which would open in 2019, will enroll only freshmen at the beginning, and upperclassmen will be left to attend nearby schools. The district expects to spend millions on the transition, including on individualized plans to help students at risk of dropping out, paid summer job programs and possible shuttle buses to transport students. Research on the benefits of school closures is mixed. In 2017, the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado Boulder compiled research finding that even when students transferred to higherperforming schools, those students saw an achievement drop in the first year and marginal gains later on. Theres no ground to stand on for saying this will improve the educational opportunities, said Pauline Lipman, a University of Illinois at Chicago professor who has studied closures. Chicago Public Schools officials disagree. With past closures, theyve emphasized cost savings. This time, theyve pitched the proposal as a more desirable option for students. Renderings of the new school tout outdoor sports facilities and a community health center. City officials say it complements other recent investment in Englewood, including a new lowercost Whole Foods. But critics, including neighborhood activists and unions, say the district didnt do enough to address problems it helped create and theres a lack of trust, especially after two consecutive CPS leaders left office under scandal. The Chicago Teachers Union blames the citys push for charter schools. Roughly 90 percent of Englewoods students travel beyond neighborhood boundaries for school. Experts say property values will drop, vacant buildings are magnets for street crime and sending students to new schools could put their lives at risk. What people dont understand is that if you are 16 years old and get on a bus, when you get off that bus you are gangaffiliated whether you are gangaffiliated or not, said activist Jitu Brown. Tensions between students from different Chicago neighborhoods attending the same school have erupted in violence before. In 2009, 16yearold honor student Derrion Albert was fatally beaten after getting caught in the middle of such a clash. The attack involving students from Fenger High School on Chicagos South Side was captured on cellphone video that was viewed online worldwide. In Englewood, crime is still high despite a significant drop in homicides and shootings there last year. The violence that remains is startling considering the dwindling population. Demographers say Englewoods population decreased from 59,000 residents in 1980 to 26,000 by 2015. In 2016, there were 86 homicides in Englewood, up from 37 the year before. The Chicago district has had trouble selling and repurposing buildings since 2013 and had to loosen guidelines for potential buyers. There are now about 27 schools on that list, but more than a dozen remain empty, including several in Englewood. Among them is Yale Elementary School, which singing and acting star Jennifer Hudson attended. The eerily quiet brick building sits near boardedup homes and empty lots. Letters on the school sign have fallen off. Under the new proposal, one school would remain vacant, two would be taken over by existing charter schools and one would be demolished for the new school. Not everyone opposes the districts plan. It would be a catalyst for new growth in the area. It gives us something that we can build on, here in Englewood, said Theodria Constanoplis, 74. She has lived in Englewood most of her life, and one of her grandchildren could attend the new school. Still, some educators remain skeptical, saying the closures mark the end of an era. Harper High School theater teacher Michael Buino said his students can compete with those who attend schools considered to be Chicagos best. Michelle Obama, who is from Chicago, visited Harper High in 2013 while still first lady. Come to my classroom and see for yourselves, Buino said at a recent community forum. And then tell me Harper is not worth saving. ___ Follow Sophia Tareen on Twitter at https:twitter.comsophiatareen .

181 Illinois rakes in millions in revenue from video game gambling Illinois rakes in millions in revenue from video game gambling Cities like Milan see tens of thousands in profits By: Tahera Rahman Posted: Feb 13, 2018 06:59 PM CST Updated: Feb 13, 2018 06:59 PM CST MILAN, Ill.  Illinois Gaming Boards video gaming records start in 2012. That year the state brought in more than three million dollars. The revenue jumped to nearly 165 million just two years later. That number has almost doubled between 2014 and 2017, coming in at more than 325 million last year. Thousands of those dollars also poured into local governments in the Quad Cities area. The Village of Milan brought in about 9,000 in 2013. Just four years later, the village is raking in seven times that amount. It can cost around 26thousand dollars to set up a video gaming center between municipal liquor licenses, a state gaming license and buying gaming machines. But Bill Cox says it can pay off if you play your cards right. Its profitable. It varies. Some places do 1415,000 a month, he says. Cox opened up six video gaming centers in the Quad Cities area in less than a year. He says small video gaming centers offer more comfort and privacy than casinos. You dont have to worry about the car. They can just pull up and walk in and play and be pretty discreet and no one really knows what theyre up to. I think thats a lot of what it brings to the table, says Cox. There are currently 11 established video gaming centers in Milan, with three more in the process of being approved. They brought in more than 60,000 last year. It goes into our general funds, so thats available for police protection, its available for general operations of the city, says Mark Hunt, Milans finance  economic director. Hunt says the video gaming industry has grown more than anyone expected. Cox is currently applying to open up another center in Milan. The numbers of locations are growing dramatically. It seems like all of them are making their mark and you dont hear about them closing, so thats a good sign on my end, Cox says. But cashing in is causing some concerns. The saturation is kind of getting to a lot of people on the street, I know that. But thats just a part of doing business, so I guess well have to see how it all plays out, says Cox. Some customers also have concerns about the number of gaming centers popping up. They say they hope the city puts a cap on how many machines are allowed in city limits. Milans finance director says right now, there arent any policy changes. Copyright 2018 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

183 Diplomacy toward North Korea is an opening, not a surrender | Chicago Sun-Times The picture of Vice President Mike Pence standing stiffly next to the trusted younger sister of North Korean dictator Kim JongUn at the Olympics in South Korea spoke a thousand words.OPINIONAfter weeks of escalating tensions, the North Korean dictator decided to use the Olympics to reach out to South Korea and to the world. He sent North Korean athletes to the games. The two Korean teams marched into the Olympic arena under a unified flag. They fielded a joint womens ice hockey team for the first time. Kims sister not only attended the ceremonies, but also issued an invitation to the South Korean president to make an official visit to the North after the games.Vice President Pence came to the games to enforce the administrations notalk policy. He stiffed Kims sister on the podium. He and his wife refused to join the crowd in standing when the Koreans marched in.We will not allow North Korean propaganda to hijack the message and imagery of the Olympic Games, he said, vowing to focus on North Korean provocations and human rights abuses, while promising new and harsher sanctions.But the message and imagery of the Olympic Games is that athletes of all nations put aside bitter conflicts to compete in contests. The space for peaceful sports competition could create the opening for serious talks.When campaigning for the presidency, South Korean President Moon Jaein promised an opening to North Korea. The jarring North Korean tests of nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles cast a pall on that. President Donald Trump responded with a characteristic combination of insult and bluster. He infamously strutted that he had a bigger nuclear button than the North Korean president.The administration ratcheted up sanctions, pushed China to get Kim under control, declared that North Korean possession of nuclear weapons was a dire national security threat and ramped up military exercises to the very borders of the North.For our South Korean allies, the escalating threats are bone chilling. There is no rational military option against North Korea. A preemptive attack would be an illegal act of aggression that would lead to massive casualties in both North and South Korea and make the U.S. a pariah among nations.Worse, the military threats only make the North Korean leadership less likely to negotiate away their nuclear weapons program. The U.S. sees North Korean nuclear weapons as offensive, threatening the U.S. and our allies. North Korea clearly sees its nuclear weapons as defensive. For an isolated dictatorship that is denounced by the U.S., a nuclear weapons capacity may serve the same purpose the U.S. claims for its own nuclear arsenal  deterring any country from attacking.President Moon would clearly like to lessen tensions and move toward better relations. He has no desire to distance himself from the U.S., but would like to bring the U.S. and North Korea to the negotiating table.What do Trump and his advisers want The notalk, bigstick policy leads to a dead end. North Korea already has nuclear weapons. Severe sanctions have not slowed its development of intercontinental missiles.The Chinese suggest that talks could start if the U.S. suspends its regular joint military exercises with South Korea and North Korea responds by suspending nuclear and missile tests. Neither the U.S. nor North Korea has expressed support for that.Kim vows to mass produce nuclear weapons Pence demands that North Korea begin denuclearization, the dismantling permanently and irreversibly of North Koreas nuclear and ballistic missile programs before there are any negotiations or loosening of sanctions or suspension of military exercises.A notalk, allswagger policy has produced nothing. If escalating military exercises and threats dont produce a war by miscalculation, they end up advertising the impotence of U.S. policy.Diplomacy isnt a surrender it is an opening. The only way North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons is if it can receive concrete guarantees against foreign attack. The only way we can live with North Korea having nuclear weapons is with dialogue and mutual steps to build trust and security.North Korea is a ruthless dictatorship with a failed economy. South Koreans are understandably fearful of war, but not exactly eager to bear the cost of rebuilding the North. Kim has made an opening gesture at the Olympic Games. Both South Korea and the U.S. have every reason to call his bluff, to seek discussions rather than to continue a notalk policy that leads only to greater tension and frustration. 
184 Mourners: Slain Chicago officer was &#39;one of the good guys&#39; Mourners: Slain Chicago officer was one of the good guys Saturday Feb 17, 2018 at 3:58 PM Feb 17, 2018 at 3:58 PM The Associated Press CHICAGO  Mourners remembered a slain Chicago police commander Saturday as a model officer and one of the good guys who was uninterested in selfpromotion, even as he moved up the departments ranks. Of all of Commander Paul Bauers responsibilities, the ones that mattered the most to him were being a good husband to his wife, Erin, and good father to his daughter, Grace, several speakers said during his funeral at the Nativity of Our Lord Church. Erin and Grace were everything, said former First Deputy Superintendent John Escalante, who grew up with Bauer and served with him for most of Bauers 31 years on the force. Bauer, 53, was gunned down Tuesday near a government building in downtown Chicago. Authorities say he was in a patrol car nearby when he heard a call that a man had run away from tactical officers who had approached to question him about recent drug dealing and a shooting in the area. They say Bauer spotted the man and chased him to an outer stairwell, where they struggled. Bauer was shot six times and was pronounced dead later that day at a hospital. Prosecutors have charged Shomari Legghette, 44, with firstdegree murder of a peace officer, armed violence, the unlawful use of a weapon by a felon and possession of a controlled substance. Legghette, whose criminal record includes a conviction for armed robbery, is being held without bond. Scores of police officers from across the U.S. joined Bauers family, friends and other mourners, including Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Gov. Bruce Rauner and former Mayor Richard Daley, at Saturdays service. Among those attending Fridays visitation and Saturdays funeral were about a dozen honor guard members from the Rockford Police Department. The Rev. Dan Brandt, a Chicago Police chaplain, described Bauer as a man of faith who attended department Bible study sessions and sat in the front row with his family at Mass. Escalante said Bauer skipped his promotion ceremony when he became a captain because he had a family trip, and didnt want to reschedule the ceremony because he didnt need the public accolade. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson recalled Bauer taking time each day to practice English with a department custodian who was learning the language, and that he died doing what came naturally  helping other officers. He was a model police officer, and one of the good guys, Johnson said. Choose the plan thats right for you. Digital access or digital and print delivery.
185 Illinois early voting starts, but not available to all Illinois early voting starts, but not available to all By SOPHIA TAREEN  2818 12:59 AM CHICAGO  Early voting for the primary election is supposed to start Thursday across Illinois, but millions of voters wont have the option because of pending candidate challenges. The states two mostpopulated counties, Cook and DuPage, have delayed early voting until as late as Feb. 21 in order to wait out final decisions on several candidate challenges. But elsewhere, particularly in smaller counties downstate, clerks plan to proceed Thursday, offering caveats to voters who want to cast ballots. The result could be confusion for voters. One candidate ballot challenge has statewide impact. A judge ruled Democratic attorney general candidate Scott Drury cant be on the ballot over questions about his filing of a candidate economic disclosure statement. However, his name will be allowed to remain while he appeals. If Drury is ultimately ruled off, votes for him wont be counted, though he could still run as a writein candidate. Because of that pending decision and others, election officials around Chicago have said they wont be ready by Thursday, in order to have time to test out equipment and prepare ballots in four languages. More than 3.5 million voters in Chicago and surrounding communities in Cook and DuPage counties would be affected. However, other county clerks say theyre ready to proceed Thursday. Ill be open for business, said Madison County Clerk Debbie MingMendoza. Im moving forward. I dont want to delay my voters an opportunity. If they want to come in and vote, I want to be ready to go. There are roughly 182,000 registered voters in southwestern Illinois Madison County, where two candidate challenges are pending. MingMendoza said voters will be notified of the issues. Election officials in far southern Illinois Pope County, where there are about 3,000 registered voters, and eastern Illinois Vermillion County, home to roughly 29,000 registered voters, plan to follow suit. In central Illinois Sangamon County, where there are about 138,000 registered voters, Clerk Don Gray said notifications will be posted in voting areas and voters pulling Democratic ballots will be told about the Drury race. The Illinois State Board of Elections did not have the total number of counties that were delaying but executive director Steve Sandvoss sent a note Wednesday seeking notification from those that werent going to start on time. Though the decision to delay is up to each jurisdiction, he strongly encouraged them to start early voting in a timely manner. Fallout from a delay in early voting could be tough to gauge. Campaigns involved in the March 20 primary havent been pushing the option the same way as years past and turnout in midterm primaries, with contests for statewide offices such as governor and congressional races, is usually low. In 2014, roughly 18 percent of the states approximately 7.5 million registered voters cast primary ballots. In the 2016 presidential primary, Illinois had far higher turnout at roughly 46 percent.

186 Duerson Act would ban pre-teen tackle football in Illinois | WZZM13.com Close Duerson Act would ban preteen tackle football in Illinois SportsPulse: While many sports are seeing rise in youth participation tackle football is seeing a dramatic drop in participation. Nancy Armour details the future of football in America and the NFL. Jimmy Golen and Caryn Rousseau, Associated Press , TEGNA 2:26 PM. EST January 25, 2018 Youth football player in a middle of a game Photo: Thinkstock, Natalya Gerasimova CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE PINTEREST CHICAGO AP  Organized tackle football would be banned for Illinois children younger than 12 years old under a bill to be unveiled on Thursday. The Dave Duerson Act to Prevent CTE is named for the Chicago Bears defensive back who was diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy after he killed himself at the age of 50. Duerson shot himself in the chest so his brain could be studied for signs of the disease that has been linked to concussions or repeated head trauma. When my father tragically took his own life, he donated his brain to science in hopes of being part of the solution, said Tregg Duerson, who like his father played football at Notre Dame. Thanks to increased attention and research on brain trauma, we know that part of the solution is to guard young childrens developing brains from the risks of tackle football, Tregg Duerson said in a statement, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press in advance of the announcement. This bill honors my familys hopes and my fathers legacy to protect future athletes and the future of football. State Rep. Carol Sente, a Democrat from Vernon Hills, announced the proposal at a news conference Thursday along with Chris Nowinski, the head of the Concussion Legacy Foundation. Also expected to attend were former Bears players Mike Adamle and Otis Wilson  a teammate of Dave Duersons on the 1985 championship team  and Liz Nicholson, the wife of former Cleveland Brown Gerry Sullivan, who has sued the NFL over its handling of concussions. We all want kids to have fun playing football and to learn to play the game the right way early on, Sente said in a statement. But the overwhelming data and powerful stories of our supporters here today show the risks of playing tackle football before turning 12 just arent worth it. CTE is a degenerative disease known to cause memory loss, violent moods and other cognitive difficulties in football players, members of the military and others who have endured repeated head trauma. It can only be diagnosed after death. Researchers believe the severity of the symptoms is increased for those who began playing football at a younger age. After years of denials, the NFL has acknowledged a link between head blows and brain disease and agreed in 2015 to a 1 billion settlement with former players. The Illinois bill is similar to a proposal in New York, and Nowinski said lawmakers in at least one other state are working to raise the age at which children begin playing tackle football. I am confident we have the science on our side and can make a very persuasive argument that safer football for youth will lead to healthier and more rewarding lives for generations to come, Sente said.  2018 Associated Press

192 As free agency nears, Bears must make call on some previous buys - Chicago The Bears are nearly six weeks removed from hiring coach Matt Nagy and the calendar is moving quickly for them to put into place plans for the rebuild of the rebuild.The NFL scouting combine begins Feb. 28 in Indianapolis and unlike last year, it doesnt lead directly into the legal tampering period that precedes free agency. A year ago when agents and teams were huddling in Indianapolis, there was almost no window between the end of the combine  where deals are hatched annually  and the period when actual contract negotiating turned legal.This year the negotiating window opens March 12 and the new league year arrives March 14, just more than three weeks off. The Bears, once again, are flush with salarycap space. The team was in excellent cap health when general manager Ryan Pace took over in January 2015 and has remained that way. But gobs and gobs of cap space year after year hasnt necessarily turned into victories in free agency. Of course, the Bears will hope for a better return on their investments this time around. Remember, as tidy as it would be, its impossible to scapegoat departed coach John Fox and his offensive staff for every free agent that turned a short Bears career into a lottery haul without providing much in return. Some flat out stunk. Some were injured and stunk.Key dates ahead Tuesday: This is the first date the NFL clubs can put the franchise or transition tag in place on players and there is a 15day window that closes at 3 p.m. March 6. Cornerback Kyle Fuller is a potential candidate for the tag, which Pace has used previously on wide receiver Alshon Jeffery.March 9: This is the final day for the Bears to pick up the 8 million 2018 option in the contract of left guard Josh Sitton to keep him from becoming an unrestricted free agent.March 12: The negotiating window for agents and teams opens at 11 a.m. While sides can discuss all parameters of a contract, nothing is binding in this period.March 14: New league year begins at 3 p.m. when contracts can be finalized and trades can be executed.March 16: The Bears are in a position where they have to make financial decisions on some of their most ineffective or injured buys in free agency. That cant be an easy process. Yes, they will pay the 3 million roster bonus defensive end Akiem Hicks is due March 16, the third day of the new league year, which is a trigger date for either payments or guarantees for a handful of players. You certainly expect them to pay the 5 million roster bonus that is due right guard Kyle Long that day and chances are good the team also will pay the 1 million roster bonus that is due for right tackle Bobby Massie as well.Beyond those three, decisions for other players on March 16 fall somewhere between a maybe and a hard no. Its reflective of the teams struggles in free agency in some cases. Tight end Dion Sims has a 6 million base salary for 2018 and 4 million of it becomes fully guaranteed if hes on the roster that day. So the Bears are either in or out with Sims after a season in which he produced only 15 receptions for 180 yards and one touchdown in 14 games. Cornerback Marcus Cooper has a 5 million base salary for 2018 and 2 million of it becomes fully guaranteed if hes on the roster that day. You would imagine the same thing goes for Cooper. If the Bears pay him 2 million, theyre unlikely to cut him. He was a major disappointment for 6 million in 2017 and the team will have to ask itself if they can count on him for productivity Outside linebacker Willie Young enters the final year of his contract with a 1 million roster bonus due. Young, who missed 12 games after suffering a torn triceps, has a base salary of 3.5 million. Safety Quintin Demps has a 500,000 roster bonus due. He turns 33 in June and missed 13 games with a fractured left forearm while former draft pick Adrian Amos enjoyed his finest season. Amos base salary is 3 million. Quarterback Mike Glennon has a fully guaranteed 2.5 million roster bonus due March 16. His contract includes offset language, however, so ultimately its possible the Bears dont end up eating any of this or at least just a portion.Timing is such that the Bears potentially could replace one or more of these players in free agency before releasing them. Its certainly possible the team views some moves as addition by subtraction. In total, there are 19 million in base salary guarantees and roster bonuses for eight of the 51 players under contract right now that are triggered on March 16 making it an interesting day to watch.As the Bears prepare to find help in free agency, they have to make calls on a handful of previous additions.bmbiggs@chicagotribune.comTwitter @BradBiggsRoster rundown: At a position of flux, Kyle Fuller helped Bears cornerbacks excel Roster rundown: Danny Trevathan remains anchor for Bears at inside linebacker Roster rundown: Bears forced to juggle as injuries hit outside linebackers Blackhawks Anthony Duclair: Theres a lot more racism than you guys think We need to know the names of those four racists ejected from the Blackhawks game Bears must decide what to do with Kyle Fuller as window for franchise tag opens Privacy Policy Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Coaches Free Agency NFL Ryan Pace Willie Young Mike Glennon Danny Trevathan

198 Hundreds gather at Bridgeport church for Cmdr. Paul Bauer&amp;apos;s wake - Chicago Tribune Hundreds of people formed a line three blocks long outside a Bridgeport church Friday for the wake of police Cmdr. Paul Bauer, who was shot and killed earlier in the week while confronting a suspect in the Loop.The mourners came from all sides of Chicago and the state, driving from as far as Bloomington and Wisconsin to pay their respects. Federal agents, including U.S. marshals and customs officials, stood in the cold outside Nativity of Our Lord Roman Catholic Church. Groups of officers from suburbs including Cicero, Waukegan, Park Ridge, Des Plaines and Oak Brook mingled with Chicago cops of all ranks.Mayor Rahm Emanuel came early, as did former Mayor Richard M. Daley . Also arriving as the wake got underway were two other Daley brothers, Cook County Commissioner John Daley and former White House chief of staff William Daley . Former police Superintendent Garry McCarthy petted a police horse on the backside while greeting an officer outside the church.Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White said he knew Bauer and considered him a friend. The fact that Bauer took it upon himself to join in pursuit of a suspect shows how deeply Bauer took his responsibility to keep the public safe, he said.We lost a hero, White said.Inside the church, Bauers wife, Erin, his 13yearold daughter, Grace, and his father and sisters greeted the stream of wellwishers who filed by the coffin. Flowers lined the church and family photos were on display.Bauer, 53, was shot six times Tuesday near the Thompson Center downtown. His alleged killer, Shomari Legghette, is being held without bond.A 31year veteran of the department, Bauer had worked all over the city, including a stint with the departments elite mounted patrol unit. He was most recently commander of the Near North District, and was the highestranking officer killed on the job in decades.He was downtown when he heard over his radio that officers working a drug detail on Lower Wacker Drive had confronted a suspect who took off running. Bauer apparently confronted a man who matched the suspects description, leading to a tussle and the fatal shooting.Chicago police Deputy Chief Kevin Ryan, who was Bauers boss, said he could always count on him to do the right thing for the right reasons.He never broke the public trust, Ryan said.Ryan said guys like Paul represent the real police.Its not always glamorous, but every day he made a difference for somebody, Ryan said.Chicago police Cmdr. Paul Bauer was shot and killed near the Thompson Center in the Loop on Feb. 13, 2018.Earlier Friday, dozens of police officers stood outside the doors of the church. The officers, along with members of the Chicago Fire Department, lined up in carefully ordered rows flanking the entrance of the building. Fifteen mounted officers lined up across the street. All wore buttons on their coats bearing a photograph of Bauer.The silver hearse containing Bauers body arrived at the church just before 12:30 p.m., led by four officers on foot. Swathed in a Chicago flag, the coppercolored casket was carried into the church by eight pallbearers, all from the Police Department, as those assembled outside saluted.Almost every home on the block displayed a blue ribbon in solidarity. A woman walking home told every officer she came across, Im sorry for your loss, including the officers in line outside her steps.Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson came out afterward to talk to reporters. He thanked the public for its support during what he said was a very difficult time.The healing process starts today for CPD and the family, he said.Johnson encouraged those attending the parade to be held in Bauers honor Saturday to wear blue in support of the late officers family.As the skies darkened late Friday afternoon, the line inching into the church in Bridgeport numbered about 1,000 people at any given time. Those who braved the cold repeatedly expressed their respect for the police and Bauer.One officer from Palatine said Bauers death reverberated beyond Chicago and called it a national tragedy.Four members of the Milwaukee Police Departments honor guard had driven south to pay their respects. Its a brotherhood, said Elvis Lock, one of the Wisconsin officers. We consider this our family.Retired Chicago police officer Anthony Ortiz said he didnt know Bauer particularly well except by reputation. But he felt he needed to come out and show respect for his fellow officer, and the job.Always a good man. Always a good policeman, Ortiz said. Cant ask for more than that.eolumhense@chicagotribune.comgpratt@chicagotribune.comRELATEDSlain Cmdr.

203 Chicago suburbs survive snowstorm SCHAUMBURG, Ill.  The Chicago suburbs got slammed by an overnight snowstorm. Highways and local streets were left snowcovered and treacherous. Multiple spinout accidents were reported in communities like Joliet, Channahon, Crest Hill, Shorewood and Bolingbrook  to name a few. Many suburban school systems chose to close for the day so did Chicago Public Schools . And many government offices , including Illinois Secretary of State offices, closed their doors for the day. As a result, expressway travel times, which could have been nightmarish, were actually shorter than normal for the morning rush. 42.033361 88.083406

India starts her statement with one word: Worthy. She then continues her note by referring to her Grammy preshow performance of I Am Light. She writes, In this performance, Worthy is behind me on this stage, because it is my favorite word, my mantra, my lifes philosophy. I KNOW NOW, with NO uncertainty, that regardless of the lack of compassion and fairness that the world shows us at times, That I AM WORTHY WE ALL ARE. My favorite definition of this word is: deserving of regard and respect. And anytime someone comes to treat me as less, I know THEY are mistaken. India adds, Neil Portnow is mistaken. His statements are a mess, but I get why he cant empathize with women and women of color. HE is saying, the more women there are, the more chances women have to WIN. She continues, BUT. WE NEED MORE WOMEN, more WOMEN OF COLOR AND MORE INCLUSIVE MINDED PEOPLE in positions of power, in the rooms where decisions are made.

212 Former Rock &amp;apos;n&amp;apos; Roll McDonald&amp;apos;s gets new ecofriendly look from riverwalk architect - Chicago Tribune The former Rock n Roll McDonalds will reopen in late spring with more trees and a sleeker, more contemporary design, courtesy of Carol Ross Barney, the renowned architect who codesigned the Chicago Riverwalk.A popular tourist attraction for decades, Chicagos flagship McDonalds is undergoing a major remodeling to reflect the global fastfood chains pivot toward the future. Gone will be the remaining rock memorabilia and giant yellow arches, to be replaced by ordering kiosks, living plant walls and solar panels.Once finished, a 19,000squarefoot onestory restaurant constructed of timber, steel and glass will replace the twostory, 24,000squarefoot McDonalds that opened in 2005, which supplanted the original building that opened in 1983. The new design aims to be more pedestrianfriendly  there will be less parking  and more energyefficient and environmentally friendly throughout.But, as franchise owner Nick Karavites pointed out, the ultimate goal of business is to make money.Theres a lot of pride being part of something so cuttingedge.  At the end of day, were still a business selling hamburgers and french fries and milkshakes and we want to sell as many as we can, said Karavites, whose familys franchise group owns 24 McDonalds restaurants in the Chicago area.As for those glowing yellow arches that are coming down, Ross Barney said: The symbolism was appropriate for its time, but its time to move on.That statement could be applied to much of what McDonalds has done in recent years as the company has made moves to break from its past, including demolishing a longtime company museum in Des Plaines and moving its headquarters this spring, from Oak Brook to Chicagos Fulton Market district. McDonalds also has launched a flurry of initiatives for future growth, including recently starting a new value menu and introducing more premium products along with delivery and curbside pickup options.Perhaps the most striking feature of the interior design rendering provided by McDonalds is the floating glass garden of ferns and white birch trees above the area where customers will place their orders, either at kiosks or at the counter. Much of the dining area is partially sectioned off from the flow of customer foot traffic to the ordering area. Employees will carry food out to customers  part of McDonalds experience of the future model that the company is in the process of rolling out to all U.S. locations.Outside, there will be more than 70 trees  roughly double the previous number  and an outdoor plaza area with seating. Solar panels will cover most of the roof and help offset nonrenewable energy costs. Atop the kitchen, which partially juts out from the glass building, will be harvestable apple trees, said Ross Barney, founder of Ross Barney Architects.PHOTOS: Renderings from McDonalds depict the new restaurant planned for Clark and Ontario streets in Chicago, while photos show demolition work continuing Jan. 29, 2018, on the McDonalds restaurant currently at the River North site. The restaurant is being modernized to include ordering kiosks and improved energy efficiency.Riverwalk architect learned environmental lessons early, in Peace Corps Youll be able to look up at the apple trees while youre eating your hamburger or whatever, Ross Barney said.Ross Barney and her firm have garnered numerous accolades for their work on the riverwalk, on which they partnered with Sasaki Associates of Watertown, Mass. Ross Barney is also known for her recent design of notable public spaces, including new CTA stops at McCormick Place and Morgan Street on the Near West Side.This is her first McDonalds.Its so interesting to work on a project like this because youre designing for an icon, Ross Barney said.Ross Barney said she considered the fastfood restaurant, like other projects in her portfolio, to be an opportunity to improve upon a public gathering space and, ultimately, make the city more livable for its residents. She was also drawn to McDonalds desire for a more energyefficient design  a personal passion of hers. Everything from the buildings heating and cooling system to the fryers are designed to use less nonrenewable energy.And though theres still a drivethru, as well as a curbside pickup area for mobile ordering, the design is intended to attract more people on foot, she said.The major change here is theres been a rebalancing to where the design is about the neighborhood and its about people, Ross Barney said.This year, McDonalds plans to invest 2.4 billion in capital projects, most of which will go toward ongoing work in converting U.S. locations to the experience of the future model, which includes ordering kiosks, table service and increasing use of the mobile app, the company said Tuesday. This year, the company plans to convert another 4,000 U.S. restaurants, which will mean roughly half of the approximately 14,000 U.S. McDonalds will have adopted the experience of the future concept. The plan is to overhaul most freestanding U.S. restaurants by 2020.Chicagos Rock n Roll McDonalds to close for remodeling, ditch rock theme Karavites restaurant at Clark and Ontario streets will be one of the largest McDonalds of the future.While McDonalds recent initiatives have been a lot for franchisees to digest, Karavites excitement about the new design is evident.Though the remodeled restaurant will be smaller, it will feel more spacious, in part because the glass walls wont be angled inward like they were in the last design, Karavites said. And though there will be a few less seats without the second floor, Karavites said he was pleased to see the company take a more thoughtful approach to improving the dining experience.Because its a flagship store, the company  and not Karavites  is shouldering the bulk of the costs associated with the project, he said. McDonalds spokeswoman Terri Hickey declined to provide specific figures or terms of the agreement.The restaurant usually employs about 120 workers, ranging up to 160 in the busy summer months. Karavites said an uptick in sales because of the new design could in turn mean more hiring.The original Rock n Roll McDonalds was razed in 2004, but many Chicagoans continued to refer to its twostory replacement with the same name. But the remaining rock memorabilia, owned by Karavites, is now in storage.What will it be called now that rock n roll has left the buildingUltimately, that will be up to the customers.Internally, we call it the Rock, Karavites said. Im going to continue calling it that.gtrotter@chicagotribune.comTwitter @GregTrotterTribBoeing profit blows past estimates with help from U.S. tax cut Longdreaded Amazon threat to drug middlemen draws closer Quiksilver CEO is missing: His boat washed up in France, empty Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Architecture McDonalds

219 Schools across Illinois struggle to find substitute teachers Illinois schools struggle to find substitute teachers Jan 25, 2018 Save BELLEVILLE, Ill. AP  Many school districts across Illinois are experiencing substitute teacher shortages, a survey shows. The survey of more than 500 superintendents was conducted by the Illinois Association of Regional Superintendents of Schools. Superintendents in southern Illinois described their shortage as more severe than most in other areas of the state. Some school officials have been recruiting substitute teachers by posting on social media, attending job fairs and asking parents for help. Several others have been offering substitute teachers more money. Illinois accepts applications for substitute teaching licenses from people who have bachelors degrees in any subject area. The application costs about 160 to 175 for the application, registration and other costs, including a background check. Most of the cost comes from the states licensing fees and can be reimbursed after 10 days on the job. The refunds are a new effort by the state to address the substitute teacher shortage. But the association suggests that further policy changes are needed at the state level to help schools recruit more substitute teachers, The Belleville NewsDemocrat reported. The association recommends amending the Teachers Retirement System. Retired teachers are limited in how often they can work and still receive pension payments. They are only allowed to work 100 days or 500 hours in a school year. The association said increasing the number of days and hours that retirees can work would significantly relieve pressure on schools.

223 Illinois man sentenced to prison in credit union, bank robberies | Local Crime &amp; Courts | qctimes.com Save A Bloomington, Illinois, man was sentenced Wednesday to 10 years in federal prison for robbing a Bettendorf credit union and an Illinois bank in 2016. Anthony Jovon Brown, 33, was ordered to pay to pay 1,615 in restitution to Ascentra Credit Union and 10,860 in restitution to DeWitt Savings Bank in Clinton, Illinois. He must serve three years of supervised release once he completes his prison term. There is no parole in the federal system. Brown pleaded guilty last year to two counts of bank robbery in U.S. District Court, Davenport. The bank robbery charge related to the incident in Clinton was transferred from the Central District of Illinois, according to court documents. According to court documents in the Bettendorf case: Bettendorf Police were called about 11 a.m. Aug. 18, 2016, to Ascentra Credit Union, 1710 Grant St., for a report of a robbery. Police learned that Brown walked into the credit union wearing a black floppy hat, black sweatshirt, blue jeans and black Nike shoes with a white swoosh. He waited in the lobby until other customers conducting business left. While waiting, Brown retrieved a credit union form that is used for deposits, withdrawals and fund transfers. He held onto the form in his bare hands while waiting in line. Brown then approached the counter and made a verbal demand for money from the teller. He produced a paper bag, which the teller filled with 4,646. Brown retrieved the bag but left the form at the tellers window. He left in a goldbrown Chevrolet Impala that was parked in an adjacent lot. Officers determined that fingerprints found on the transaction form belonged to Brown. They also compared Browns drivers license photo to still images taken from surveillance footage at the time of the robbery. On Aug. 23, 2016, police arrested Brown at his relatives home in Bloomington. Officers found clothing that appeared to be similar to those worn by the credit union robber. They also found 3,031 in the pocket of a black sweatshirt that was recovered. Part of the money was in a plastic bag, while some was in a cup inside another bag. Officers also located a 2003 Chevrolet Impala, registered to Brown, in the driveway. Inside, they found a hat similar to the one worn during the credit union robbery. The next day, Brown was interviewed by Bettendorf police and the FBI at the McClean County Jail. Brown said during the interview that he robbed the credit union and that he used some of the money on food, gas, marijuana and a trip to St. Louis, according to court documents. According to an indictment filed in the Clinton case, the robbery occurred on July 1, 2016. Love

236 Inmates who clapped for Chicago cop death suspect may face reprisals | State and Regional | herald-review.com Inmates who clapped for Chicago cop death suspect may face reprisals DON BABWIN Associated Press Buy Now Chicago police officers arrive for a news conference at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, regarding Cmdr. Paul Bauer, who was killed earlier in Chicago on Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2018. The offduty police commander was shot and killed Tuesday afternoon in downtown Chicago after he spotted a man matching the radio description of an armed suspect officers were chasing on foot, the citys police superintendent said. Nuccio DiNuzzoChicago Tribune via AP Nuccio DiNuzzo Save CHICAGO  Five Cook County Jail inmates who applauded as the man charged with the fatal shooting of a Chicago police commander was led by their cell could face reprisals for their actions, a jail official said Friday. Cara Smith, the chief policy officer for Sheriff Tom Dart, said a security video shows them clapping as suspect Shomari Legghette was being led past a crowded holding cell on Thursday after his first court appearance. The inmates were in the holding cell awaiting action on their cases. Legghette is charged with firstdegree murder in Tuesdays shooting death of Commander Paul Bauer. She said the five inmates were transferred overnight from Chicago to a jail in southern Illinois, where it will be more difficult for family and friends to visit them while they are in custody. Suspect in Chicago police death charged with murder CHICAGO  A man with a long criminal history that includes a conviction for armed robbery ha The jail also is forwarding to prosecutors the video and reports of the incident Thursday afternoon so they can use the information if the inmates are convicted, she said. The conduct that those detainees engaged in was disgraceful... and speaks to their character, Smith said. We feel it should be considered by prosecutors in connection with their sentencing. The video could be a factor of aggravation considered by a judge in sentencing. But Steve Greenberg, a prominent Chicago defense attorney, said there is no way the inmates should be penalized for what he said is a clear exercise of their right to free speech. These inmates ... no matter how vile or disgusting you may think their expression is, they have an absolute right under the First Amendment to express those feelings and it is a violation of their rights as citizens to penalize them or consider that as aggravation, said Greenberg, who is not representing any of the men. The video was taken moments after the 44yearold Legghette appeared in court on charges of firstdegree murder of a peace officer, armed violence, unlawful use of a weapon by a felon and possession of a controlled substance. Police say they wanted to question Legghette Tuesday when he took off running and Bauer pursued him on foot. He caught Legghette near the James R. Thompson Center, a government building, where the two struggled and Legghette fell down the stairs. Bauer either fell or ran after him to a landing where, Legghette, wearing a bullet proof vest and armed with a semiautomatic handgun, allegedly shot the 53yearold Bauer six times. Bauer, a 31year veteran of the police force, was pronounced dead a short time later. City mourns a hero Hundreds of people formed a line three blocks long outside a Bridgeport church Friday for Bauers wake. Police officers from around the state and federal agents, including U.S. marshals, stood in the cold outside Nativity of Our Lord Roman Catholic Church to show their respect. Groups of officers from such places as Cicero, Waukegan, Park Ridge, Des Plaines and Oak Brook mingled with Chicago cops of all ranks. Almost every home on the block displayed a blue ribbon in solidarity. A woman walking home told every officer she came across, Im sorry for your loss, including the officers who stood in line outside her steps. Mayor Rahm Emanuel came early, as did former Mayor Richard M. Daley. Also arriving were two other Daley brothers, Cook County Commissioner John Daley and former White House chief of staff Bill Daley. Former police Superintendent Garry McCarthy petted a police horse on the backside while greeting an officer outside the church. Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White who has a facility in Decatur said he knew Bauer and considered him a friend. The fact that Bauer took it upon himself to join in pursuit of a suspect shows how deeply Bauer took his responsibility to keep the public safe, he said. We lost a hero, White said. Inside the church, Bauers wife, Erin, his 13yearold daughter, Grace, along with his father and sisters greeted the stream of well wishers who filed by the coffin. Flowers lined the church and family photos were on display. Chicago police Deputy Chief Kevin Ryan, who was Bauers boss, said he could always count on him to do the right thing for the right reasons. He never broke the public trust, Ryan said. Ryan said guys like Paul represent the real police. Its not always glamorous but every day he made a difference for somebody, Ryan said. Four officers from Milwaukee police departments honor guard drove south to pay their respects. Its a brotherhood, said Elvis Lock, one of the Wisconsin officers. we consider this our family. Earlier Friday, dozens of police officers stood outside the doors of the church. The officers, along with members of the Chicago Fire Department, lined up in carefully ordered rows flanking the entrance of the building. Fifteen mounted officers lined up across the street from that group. All wore buttons on their coats bearing a photograph of Bauer. The silver hearse containing Bauers body arrived at the church just before 12:30 p.m., led by four officers on foot. Swathed in a Chicago flag, the coppercolored casket was carried into the church by eight pallbearers, all from the Police Department, as those assembled outside saluted. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson came out afterward to talk to reporters. He thanked the public for its support during what he said was a very difficult time. The healing process starts today for CPD and the family, he said. Johnson encouraged those attending the parade to be held in Bauers honor Saturday to wear blue in support of the late officers family.

241 In and out of Chicago Hello there, My wife and I are over from the UK end of Sep 18 for 2 weeks, flying into and out of Chicago. We have our first 3 nights in Chicago, and Im sure we will find stuff to do there  no problem. Were taking in the Smoky Mountains most likely staying in Gatlinburg for 4 nights  so any recommends for a 1 night stop off on the way south from Chicago gratefully received, Nashville for 2 nights and 2 nights in Memphis to take in Graceland of course and the surrounding area. I also fancy the Harley Davidson museum in Milwaukee. So, the big question is  and taking someall of our preferences into account  what would be the best trip to take in terms of sights etc. We both love small town America, Americana, talking to the locals, wildlife, scenery and just immersing ourselves into the American way of life. After a little research were thinking we might do St Louis and Springfield IL the Abraham Lincoln thing coming back north. Thank you for your time. Regards, Paul  Deanie

CHICAGO AP  Authorities say a serial stowaway who sneaked onto plane in Chicago earlier this month and made it to London has been arrested again after being spotted at OHare International Airport. Marilyn Hartman, of Grayslake, was taken into custody early Sunday and charged with misdemeanor trespassing on state land and violating the conditions of her bail bond that were set last week by the judge who warned her to stay away from airports. Police say they were responding to a call of someone refusing to leave the airport when they spotted the 66yearold Hartman at a terminal. Hartmans most recent arrest came after police say she slipped past a security checkpoint at OHare and boarded a flight without a ticket or boarding pass. She was arrested in London and flown back to Chicago. Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

KimChicago Tribune via AP prev next comments CHICAGO  A man with a long criminal history that includes a conviction for armed robbery has been charged with firstdegree murder in the fatal shooting of a Chicago police commander, authorities announced Wednesday.Shomari Legghette, 44, was also charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm, armed violence and possession of narcotics after police say they discovered he was carrying heroin, crack cocaine and marijuana. Legghette was armed with a semiautomatic handgun that had a 30round magazine, and was wearing body armor under a heavy black jacket, police said.At an emotional news conference Wednesday, police Superintendent Eddie Johnson talked about the suspect, but also described Cmdr. Paul Bauers final moments as he assisted other officers Tuesday afternoon in pursuit of Legghette.When Paul heard the radio call, he didnt turn the other way to let someone else worry about it, Johnson said. He didnt worry about his rank or the fact that he wasnt in his own district. He just ran towards where he was needed without hesitation.The 53yearold Bauer, wearing his police uniform, was in his car after having lunch near the James R. Thompson Center, a downtown government building, when he heard the call, police said Wednesday. Tactical officers had approached Legghette in an area where there had been reports of drug sales but Legghette ran away before they reached him.Bauer, a 31year department veteran, jumped from his car and ran after Legghette, who matched the description that he heard on his radio. Police said Bauer chased Legghette to the top of a stairwell, where the two fought, before Legghette grabbed him and the two of them fell down the stairwell.Area Central Detectives Commander Brendan Deenihan said witnesses said  and an audio recording from a nearby taxi confirmed  that seven shots were fired at the bottom of the stairwell. All the shots came from the gun that Legghette was carrying and officers later recovered, Deenihan said.Bauer did not draw his weapon, Deenihan said.Police officers arrested Legghette a short time later in the stairwell.A person who was briefed on the investigation but was not authorized to speak said Bauer was shot multiple times in the head. The person spoke on condition of anonymity. Officials did not discuss this detail at the news conference and the medical examiners office only said that Bauer was shot to death.Legghette has been arrested repeatedly and, according to the Illinois Department of Corrections, he has several felony convictions on his record dating back to the 1990s that have landed him in prison. Most of them are drugrelated, but his record also includes crimes that show a willingness to use a gun.According to the Department of Corrections, he was sentenced to prison in 1999 for armed robbery and after he was released, he was arrested again and sentenced to prison for possession of a firearm with a defaced serial number. Legghette was released from prison in 2008 before returning the next year after being convicted again for possession of a firearm with a defaced serial number.Shortly after he was placed on parole, he returned to prison after it was revoked when he tested positive for drugs. He returned to prison again in 2015 after he was convicted for possession of a controlled substance.One arrest in particular struck Johnson as a chilling prelude to what unfolded on Tuesday.In 2007, he was arrested for unlawful use of body armor, unlawful use of a weapon, armed violence and drug possession, the police superintendent said.Johnson, who has repeatedly urged lawmakers to pass tougher laws to keep repeat gun offenders locked up, said Legghettes record should have forfeited his right to freedom.Some people dont deserve to walk the streets of Chicago, Johnson said. He was one of them.It was a similar message that Bauer himself shared at a gathering of business professionals just a few months before he died.Even when we catch somebody, theres still a long way to go to get them off the street, Bauer said at the Nov. 14 gathering, according to a report in the Loop North News. Were not talking about the guy that stole a loaf of bread from the store to feed his family. Were talking about career robbers, burglars, drug dealers. These are all crimes against the community. They need to be off the street.Deenihan said Legghette has refused to talk to police. He is in custody and is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday.
249 STOCKS ON TRACK FOR BEST WEEK SINCE ’16… SEC Blocks Chinese Takeover of Chicago Stock Exchange February 16, 2018 Stocks close higher for fifth straight session as Dow reclaims 25,000level The Dow rose to close above the 25,000 mark Thursday for the first time in nearly two weeks as U.S. stocks finished higher for a fifth straight session in volatile trade. Wall Street opened solidly higher but subsequently lost ground before recouping losses, supported by the latest data on inflation and the labor market, which pointed to an economy that was growing but in no imminent danger of overheating. Strong results at Cisco also highlighted how American corporations continue to fare well in the current environment. How did the main benchmarks perform The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, 1.23 rose 306.88 points, or 1.2, to 25,200.37. The SP 500 SPX, 1.21 added 32.57 points, or 1.2, to 2,731.20. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, 1.58 gained 112.81 points, or 1.6, to 7,256.43. So far this week, the Dow and the SP are both up more than 4 and on track for their biggest weekly percentage rise since November 2016. The Nasdaq is up over 5, which represents its best week since October 2014. Those gains come after sharp losses seen earlier this month, which pushed the Dow and SP into correction territory, or a 10 drop from a peak. The three gauges stand between 4 and 6 below last months alltime highs. The selloff was sparked in part by rising bond yields amid signs of an uptick in inflation, with the higher yields luring money out of equities. Strategists have said the selloff was overdue, but was excessive . SEC blocks Chicago Stock Exchange sale to Chinabased investors Reuters  U.S. regulators on Thursday killed the politically sensitive sale of the Chicago Stock Exchange CHX to a group led by Chinabased investors, saying a lack of information on the wouldbe buyers threatened the ability to properly monitor the exchange after the deal. The move by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ends a twoyear battle to gain approval for the sale and underscores the more hostile environment facing Chinese buyers under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump brought the CHX deal up twice during the election campaign as an example of how jobs and wealth were leaving the United States. SEC staff initially approved the sale of the privately owned exchange in August, but within minutes of the announcement SEC commissioners, led by Chairman Jay Clayton, a Trump appointee, put the decision on hold for further review. U.S. lawmakers from both parties had harshly criticized the deal in joint letters to the SEC, arguing that it would give the Chinese government access to American financial markets and questioning the SECs ability to regulate and monitor foreign owners.

256 New OC Rod Smith vows to spice up Illinois offense New OC Rod Smith vows to spice up Illinois offense By The Associated Press January 26, 2018 6:13 pm 01262018 06:13pm Share CHAMPAIGN, Ill. AP  Rod Smith had a bit of music for the ears of Illinois fans who watched the Illini scuffle along on offense last season. Were going to try to make them defend the entire field, said Smith, who was formally introduced Friday as the new offensive coordinator at Illinois. I think the hardest skill to do in football is tackle a skillkid in open field. . Were going to try to get guys out in space. Smith spent six years as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Arizona, helping establish it as one of the best offensive teams in the country. Last season, the Wildcats averaged 41.3 points fifth in the FBS and 489.5 total yards per game. A lot of that success was because of Khalil Tate, a dualthreat quarterback who scored 26 total touchdowns. The situation under center isnt as clear at Illinois. Last season, the Illini averaged just 15.3 points 126th in the FBS, 280.4 yards of total offense and never scored more than 24 points in a game. Coach Lovie Smith started three different quarterbacks but wound up 210 overall and 09 in the Big Ten. I think most of our fans will agree, we need to score more points, Lovie Smith said. Its as simple as that. Two of those three starting quarterbacks are no longer with the team, leaving sophomore Cam Thomas as the only scholarship quarterback on the roster. Thomas appeared in four games, starting two, but completed just 42.4 percent of his passes and throwing five interceptions. He never scored through the air, but had 52 rushes for 233 yards and a touchdown. Still, the Smiths said they will look to add more experience. Regardless of who starts at quarterback, Rod Smith said he plans to implement a spread, runfirst offense. In 2017, Arizona averaged nearly 46.9 passes and 22.7 rushes per game. Illinois has a number of young playmakers returning. Sophomore running back Mike Epstein missed the last seven games of the season with a foot injury, but still finished with a teamhigh 346 rushing yards and three touchdowns. Sophomores Ricky Smalling and Louis Dorsey proved to be two of Illinois best pass catchers. Smalling averaged a teamhigh 16.5 yards per catch and led the Illini with 510 receiving yards. Dorsey led all tight ends with 395 receiving yards and hauled in a teamhigh three touchdowns. Epstein, Smalling and Dorsey were three of 16 true freshmen starters last year, the most in school history. When you play so many freshmen, its tough, Rod Smith said. Thats tough sledding, particularly in the Big Ten. But thatll pay off. . Hopefully we start reaping some of those benefits in the spring. Copyright  2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

257 Chicago Stock Exchange mulls options after sale blocked Chicago Stock Exchange mulls options after sale blocked Adds quotes from CHX background on deal that was blocked By John McCrank NEW YORK, Feb 16 Reuters  The Chicago Stock Exchange said on Friday it was evaluating its options after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission blocked the sale of the bourse to a group of U.S. and Chinabased investors due to the opaque nature of the buyers and their funds. The SEC killed the politically sensitive deal on Thursday, ending a twoyear effort to sell the exchange, known as CHX, to a consortium of investors led by Chinas Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group and its U.S. affiliate North American Casin Holdings. By disapproving the transaction, the SEC has denied the American public an historic and unprecedented opportunity to build a mutually beneficial economic bridge between the worlds largest economies, while unfairly disadvantaging our company and shareholders, CHX said in a statement. SEC staff initially approved the roughly 25 million deal for the privately held exchange. But the agencys commissioners, led by Jay Clayton, an appointee of U.S. President Donald Trump, stayed the decision pending their own review. CHX, a niche player with a market share of around 0.5 percent, had hoped the deal would help it become a conduit for Chinese companies to list in the United States. Casin also said it planned eventually to build an exchange in China using CHX technology. But on Thursday the SEC said CHX could not provide key information it had requested, including access to the potential owners books. The SEC also said the deals structure could let new, unknown entities assume stakes over time and that, overall, it was not convinced the exchange would be properly monitored after a deal. The SEC order contains logic and representations with which CHX strongly disagrees, the exchange said. The deal was proposed in February 2016 and was the target of harsh criticism by a group of lawmakers led by Republican Congressman Robert Pittenger. They claimed in letters to the SEC that Casins control of CHX could allow the Chinese government access to American financial markets. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which scrutinizes acquisitions for potential national security concerns, approved the sale in August 2016, but it ultimately hinged on SEC approval.

Junior power forward Leron Black scored a careerhigh 28 points in the win. Illinois is yet to win a Big Ten road game this season. The Illini, one of four threewin teams in the Big Ten, is locked in to one of the 1114 seeds in next weeks Big Ten tournament, meaning theyll begin play Wednesday at Madison Square Garden in New York. MSU update: The Spartans are coming off the largest comeback in Big Ten history, from 27 points down to beat Northwestern on Saturday. It was MSUs 10th straight win and puts the Spartans all alone in first place in the Big Ten standings, a game up on Ohio State and Purdue. MSU can clinch at least a share of the conference title with a win Tuesday over an Illinois team it beat by doubledigits a month ago in Champaign. This is the final home game for three MSU seniors, reserves Tum Tum Nairn, Gavin Schilling and Ben Carter, and likely the last game at Breslin Center for sophomore Miles Bridges and freshman Jaren Jackson Jr., both of whom are considered lottery picks in the upcoming NBA draftMORE: Couch: Tum Tum Nairn leads a senior class that Tom Izzo didnt want but is grateful for  About the matchup: The last time these teams met, Jan. 22 in Champaign, MSU couldnt miss but couldnt hang on to the basketball  shooting 68 percent as a team, while committing 25 turnovers. The Illinis defense is known for making opponents speed up uncomfortably, which explains some of the carelessness. Teams are also shooting almost 47 percent against Illinois, which partly explains MSUs percentage that night. Sophomore forward Nicholas Kipper scored a careerhigh 27 against the Spartans last time out, hitting 5 of 8 3pointers. Hes since been added to the starting lineup. On most nights, Illinois simply doesnt have the offensive firepower or rim protection to stay with MSU. Prediction: If this were a late January game, perhaps a snowy midweek night in the middle of a long stretch, maybe MSU might sleepwalk into an upset scare against Illinois. But this is senior night, with a Big Ten title on the line, coming off a game where MSU sleepwalked through the first half. Meanwhile, Illinois just had its own satisfying big win at home. The dynamic doesnt set up well for the Illini.

262 National Study Hammers Illinois Budget Practices By Sean Crawford  Jan 23, 2018 A national study of state government budgeting gives Illinois low marks. Credit Brian Mackey Its no surprise to see Illinois fare poorly when it comes to finances. A two year budget impasse created even more problems. Its hard to gauge the success of the budget in Illinois when you didnt have one, said Bill Glasgall with the nonpartisan Volcker Alliance, which conducted the analysis titled Truth And Integrity In State Budgeting: What is The Reality The Alliance graded the states in categories like budget maneuvers, forecasting, reserve funds and more. Each state was given a grade, with Dminus being the lowest. Among all states, Illinois was near the bottom for how it puts budgets together and deals with what it owes. Glasgall said during the impasse, the state continued to spend more money than it was taking in. The state whipped out its credit card and put 16million dollars on account, he said. That to me is a sign of, if not fiscal distress, darn close to it. The state passed a budget and an income tax increase last summer. But Glasgall points out more revenue will likely be necessary going forward. The survey of all 50 states found some are better than others when it comes to budget forecasting, putting money aside and paying down long term debts like public pensions. But Illinois was among the worst states overall in most categories. Glasgall is especially critical of how Illinois handles what are called legacy costs like state employee health care and pensions. Basically services the state consumed, but didnt pay for and either put it on a credit card or just pushed the expenditure off, he said. Illinois has among the most underfunded pension system in the country. When it comes to recommendations, Glasgall said Illinois needs to stick to paying bills in the year they come due. He said the state could also raise money by broadening its sales tax base and reviewing tax incentives to make sure they are working as intended. Glasgall said the report did find one bright spot. He said Illinois does pretty well when it comes to transparency, earning a C grade. He says at least the state shows how bad things are.
263 Judge Denies Equal Locker Room Access For Transgender Student, Cites Illinois Law 5 min Linda LuttonWBEZ Palatine High School student Nova Maday in 2017. Madays request for unrestricted access to the school locker room was denied on Thursday. A transgender student from Palatine who had sued her highschool district for full and unrestricted access to the girls locker room lost in court on Thursday.   A Cook County Judge Judge Thomas Allen ruled against Nova Maday , an 18yearold senior in Township High School District 211 in the northwest suburbs. Maday was born a boy but has lived as a girl for at least three years. She sued the district last fall in a bid to win unrestricted access to the girls locker room. It is the districts second big case involving a transgender student fighting for locker room access. District 211, with schools in Palatine, Schaumburg, and Hoffman Estates, is the largest high school district in the state.     WBEZ education reporter Linda Lutton explains the judges ruling and its implications. On what is allowed regarding locker room access in District 211 The district allows transgender students like Maday to use the locker room or bathroom facility that matches their gender identity. Nova was offered that access. But the district requires that transgender students agree to change behind privacy stalls in the locker rooms  and transgender students are the only students who must agree to use these stalls when changing. Maday and her lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union argued that ostracized her. It felt like discrimination and segregation. On the judges decision Judge Allen called this case the balancing act of all balancing acts. He seemed sympathetic to the fact that the school district faces demands from transgender students like Maday, who want broader access. But the district has also been sued by a group called Students and Parents for Privacy. That group doesnt want transgender kids in the locker rooms at all. They say transgender students should use private bathrooms. Schools should never be forced to give male students unrestricted access to areas where girls are changing clothes, said Thomas Brejcha, chief counsel for the Thomas More Society, which represents the District 211 privacy group. Claiming a female gender identity doesnt change that. The judge made his decision based on a strict reading of the Illinois Human Rights Act, which is meant to prohibit discrimination. Generally, the act guarantees full and equal access in all settings. However, the judge pointed to a 2010 amendment to the act that applies only to schools. That language guarantees access, but not full and equal access. The judge said he couldnt guess why Illinois lawmakers made a distinction for schools, only that he was basing his decision on the plain language of the law. On how the various sides reacted The school district said the decision upholds the balance its been trying for in serving all its 12,000 students. Superintendent Dan Cates said the district has an unwavering commitment to respecting all students, while also safeguarding student privacy. The ACLU said it was extremely disappointed in the decision. Spokesman Ed Yohnka said it brought up a bigger question. After years and years of hardfought efforts to ensure that we have a Human Rights Act that protects against discrimination in the state of Illinois ... we are now being told there is a place where that discrimination is permitted, and that is in our public schools, Yonka said. And I think that is something that frankly ought to alarm people. On what the ruling means for Maday, as well as for other school districts and transgender students For Maday, it means she wont get to take gym class in this last semester of her senior year  at least not with access to the locker room in the way she wanted. All I want is to be accepted by my school for who I am  a girl, Maday said in a statement issued after the ruling. Thursdays decision reaffirms the practices in School District 211, but it has no impact beyond the district. Thats actually a difficult situation for school districts. Many find themselves confronted with similar issues  balancing demands for access for transgender students with privacy concerns brought by other parents or students. The Obama Administration had given school districts guidance about accommodating transgender students. But that guidance was retracted by the Trump Administration. There are other, similar cases to Madays around the country. Theyre in state courts and federal courts, and these courts are sometimes issuing conflicting decisions. Many school districts have said they would like the courts to weigh in on this, and theyd like a definitive decision. Linda Lutton covers education for WBEZ. Follow her on Twitter at @WBEZeducation .

265 Josh McDaniels, John DeFilippo both praise Bears and Ryan Pace for hiring process - Chicago Tribune Two of the six candidates the Bears met with in the hiring process that led to the selection of Matt Nagy as head coach are gearing up for Super Bowl LII in three days.Had the Bears set their focus on Eagles quarterback coach John DeFilippo or Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, the soonest they could have hired the coach would have been the Monday after the Super Bowl. General manager Ryan Pace went with Nagy, the former Chiefs offensive coordinator, and things are settling into place at Halas Hall.McDaniels is expected to be named the new coach of the Colts next week and DeFilippo, who is coming out of contract, has been linked as a candidate to replace Pat Shurmur as the Vikings offensive coordinator. McDaniels was buttoned up when asked about his meeting with the Bears and what background his brother Ben, an assistant on John Foxs staff, was able to provide.Look, all the people that came were really impressive, Josh McDaniels said. Id rather not get into that at this point. Im kind of focused on this week and this game. Those people were great. Mr. McCaskey, Ryan Pace, they did a great job, and they picked a great coach.DeFilippo, 39, who emerged as a hot candidate this year after working two years with Carson Wentz, was much more engaging on the process.I had a great meeting with the Bears and I had a fantastic time talking football, DeFilippo said. The interview lasted probably about five, 5frac12 hours, but it felt like it was about half an hour because thats how smooth it went. Ryan Pace was unbelievably organized and had done a ton of background work on me. Knew a ton about me. I had done my background work on them, so it was very, very smooth dialogue.I thought I did a very good job of explaining how I see a football program being run, everything from the team to nutrition, sports science, all of those things. At the end of the day, they chose a great football coach in Matt Nagy.As part of his research, DeFilippo studied up on quarterback Mitch Trubisky and liked what he saw.I always keep an eye on those guys from afar, he said. You have to in terms of your future employment, their future employment, trades. The NFL is a fickle business and youre going to be coaching someone or they are going to be on your team before you know it. You always keep an eye on guys. I had watched Mitch coming out of college a good deal. I wouldnt say a great deal because we already had Carson. ... We didnt go through that whole process with Mitch, but I really liked him on tape.DeFilippo was also considered by the Cardinals before they hired Steve Wilks. It wasnt DeFilippos first time interviewing for a top job. The 49ers met with him in 2016 before hiring Chip Kelly. Landing with the Eagles when he didnt get that job has put him back in the spotlight again quickly.Its like anything, the more atbats you have, the better you get at this thing, DeFilippo said. I felt this was my first real goround in terms of being kind of a serious player in the thing. I think I represented myself well and gained a lot of confidence. If the opportunity happens to come again in the future, I know I will be ready.bmbiggs@chicagotribune.comTwitter @BradBiggsThe Bears missed out on Patriots CB Stephon Gilmore in free agency last year.

269 Emirates Justifies Tying 71 year old Nigerian Onboard Flight To Chicago – MeenatNigeria.Com 0 comments Emirates airlines has justified the tying up of a Nigerian septuagenarian, Pa. David Ukesone onboard a Chicago bound flight from Dubai. Emirates in a statement by its media consultant in Nigeria said that the 71yearold passenger was restrained onboard its flight because he was unruly and forced his way into another passengers seat even after biting him. According to the statement, Emirates can confirm that Mr. Ukesone was a passenger on flight EK235 from Dubai to Chicago on 23 January, and that he had to be restrained by cabin crew members due to unruly behaviour during the flight. Despite the best efforts of our crew to intervene and reason with him, Mr. Ukesone repeatedly disturbed other passengers, refused to remain in his assigned seat, and forced his way into another cabin class. He also assaulted crew and bit another passenger. As a consequence, he was restrained by our crew. Our cabin crew is highly trained to ensure the safety and security of our passengers, and constantly monitored Mr. Ukesones welfare throughout the flight. The safety and security of our passengers and crew is of the utmost importance and will not be compromised. Upon arrival at the airport, the passenger was handed over to the authorities in Chicago. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the other passengers on the flight for their understanding, in particular, the individuals who had assisted our crew during the flight. Ukesone had alleged that a flight crew bound, punched, taped his mouth shut for hours onboard a Chicagobound flight he was taking to reunite with his family. He said the flight was eight hours away from landing at Chicagos OHare International Airport, before the onboard incident.

272 New gadgets that take smart homes to the next level – Chicago Daily Herald Posted by: Admin If you have ever wanted to experience zero gravity but cant afford a trip to the moon, the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas may have a solution. A new bathtub gives the feeling of weightlessness while users bathe by mimicking the natural position of astronauts when they float in lowgravity conditions. If weightlessness isnt for you, there are plenty of other smarthome gadgets that can bring your living spaces to the cutting edge of home design. Many of this years products demonstrate that smarthome technology is no longer restricted to performing one isolated task. Theres a door alert system that not only provides LED nightlights but also extends the range of your homes WiFi. A voiceactivated smart mirror can change the lighting to preset options, tell you todays weather and traffic, and play music from your favorite Internet stations. Jesse Lemel, senior product manager at Kohler, explained why manufacturers are designing products that fulfill more than one function. We know from our market research you dont have enough counter space today and you dont have enough outlets today, Lemel said. Do you really want to take up that countertop space and that outlet so you can add this feature Or would you rather seamlessly integrate it Fully integrated home security systems are another prominent trend in the smarthome space, with one brand incorporating security features even though it isnt traditionally considered a home security company. The automatic lighting system has a button that allows homeowners to quickly turn on preselected lights if they hear an intruder. In designing the new gadgets, Lemel said, tech firms are trying to devise how do you take known, little, everyday things to make that experience a little bit better Here are some of the new home devices introduced at the CES: The ADT Video Doorbell can be controlled by an app.  MUST CREDIT: ADT Home Security  ADT Security Services introduced its Video Doorbell that will integrate with the rest of the home security products under the ADT Pulse brand. Locking or unlocking doors and activating the wholehouse alarm system can be controlled via the mobile app.  A new conversion kit from Kwikset lets you turn traditional door locks into smart locks you can control from any Internetconnected device. The ZWave technology is compatible with several major lock brands, not just Kwikset, and allows users to monitor which doors are locked as well as provide remote entry to their home for visitors.  The Casta lighting system by Lutron combines making life easier with several security features. In addition to customizing lighting preferences and schedules, the device has an All On bedside button option that turns all the preselected lights in the house to ward off intruders. It also can turn lights on and off randomly to make it appear that someone is home. The lighting system also integrates with Nest Thermostat and smoke alarms. If the alarm is triggered, blinds will open and lights will turn on automatically so people can see their way to escape.  Ring, the home security company once known only for its line of video doorbells, has unveiled a full suite of monitoring devices that integrate with their new app. This includes a set of battery powered and motionactivated outdoor lights that integrate with the alarm and cameras to send alerts to the users mobile device. It also includes motionactivated cameras some of which can be battery powered, flood and freeze detectors, smoke and carbon monoxide sensors and a discreet control hub that integrates all the systems.  The home security system Vivent previewed its Streety that lets neighbors upload recordings from their security cameras to share with other approved users they must live within a 300yard radius. Users can attach messages to the recordings to start a conversation about the recorded event as well as request footage from other users for specific dates and times. The app will debut this spring.  Beam, one of several homemonitoring devices showcased by Zmodo, sends alerts to a mobile device when doors are open including interior doors, extends a homes WiFi range and provides LED night lighting in three color options. The Carrier ductless air conditioner comes with a connected WiFi feature.  MUST CREDIT: Carrier HVAC Carrier introduced a ductless air conditioner with the highest efficiency rating on the market. The 9,000 BTUh singlezone air conditioner can also provide heat during winter and manage humidity levels using an integrated humidity sensor.

273 Put Down the Shovel, Your Heart May Thank You For It says Chicago Cardiologist Dr. Harry Cohen   Put Down the Shovel, Your Heart May Thank You For It says Chicago Cardiologist Dr. Harry Cohen The biggest snowstorm of the year is bearing down on the Chicagoland area and while outside may look like a winter wonderland, it could be creating a perfect storm for cardiac arrest. CHICAGO, IL,   The biggest snowstorm of the year is bearing down on the Chicagoland area and while outside may look like a winter wonderland, it could be creating a perfect storm for cardiac arrest. Shoveling can be a dangerous activity, causing approximately 100 deaths each winter . Most people underestimate how much shoveling can strain the heart, says cardiologist Dr. Harry Cohen of CardioMedical Associates, Ltd in Chicago. it can be especially dangerous for those who have or are at risk for heart disease. Shoveling, or pushing a heavy snow blower, can cause a sudden increase in blood pressure and heart rate while the cold air constricts blood vessels and decreases the flow of oxygen to the heart. Together, these two factors can trigger a potentially fatal heart attack. Those who have suffered a prior heart attack, smoke, lead a sedentary lifestyle or have a heart disease, high blood pressure or high cholesterol have an increased risk. Dr. Cohen advises against shoveling if you have a history of heart disease and advises everyone to be aware of the dangers of shoveling. Enjoy your day off and stay indoors instead of shoveling, Dr. Cohen says. If you must shovel, check out these tips from the National Safety Council for safe, heart healthy shoveling. Before Shoveling  Talk to your doctor and make sure its safe for you to shovel  Wait to shovel at least 30 minutes after waking up  Warm up muscles before shoveling by walking for a few minutes or marching in place.  Do not eat a heavy meal before shoveling  Do not drink coffee or smoke for at least one hour before or one hour after shoveling While Shoveling  Only shovel fresh, powdery snow as it is lighter  Push snow instead of lifting it. If you do lift it, use a small shovel and lift with your legs, not your back  Do not work to the point of exhaustion. Work slowly and take frequent, 15minute breaks  Drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration  Dress in layers and make sure your head, neck and mouth are covered  Watch for signs of a heart attack: lightheadedness, dizziness, shortness of breath, tightness or burning in chestneckarmsback. If you think you are having a heart attack, call 911. About Harry Cohen, M.D. Dr. Harry Cohen has practiced cardiology and internal medicine for 30 years and has served as a medical educator, researcher, lecturer and presenter at numerous conferences and symposia throughout his professional career. Since heart disease continues to be the largest health problem, statistically, facing both men and women, he is a strong advocate for the practice of preventive cardiology and believes that individuals with a family history of heart disease should begin cardiologic examinations, and embrace a hearthealthy lifestyle, while still in their twenties to prevent significant heart problems later in life. Dr. Cohen earned his Doctor of Medicine degree from New York Medical College in 1984 and pursued postgraduate study in cardiology and internal medicine at St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center in New York City. Dr. Cohen is licensed to practice medicine in New York, New Jersey, Illinois and New Mexico. He has earned a variety of medical certifications, including Diplomate, National Board of Examiners in 1984 Diplomate, American Board of Internal Medicine in 1987 Diplomate, Subspecialty Board of Cardiovascular Disease, American Board of Internal Medicine in 1989 and Diplomate of the National Board of Echocardiography with certification in Adult Transthoracic Plus Stress Echocardiography in 2009. He is a Fellow of the American Collee of Cardiology and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions. In addition to his private practice at CardioMedical Associates, Ltd., with Chicago offices at 2800 N. Sheridan Road, Suite 100, and 9000 S. Stony Island Avenue. Dr. Cohen has been an attending physician at St. Joseph Hospital in Chicago since 1990 Consulting Physician at Kindred Hospitals of Chicago since 1997 General Attending Physician at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center in Chicago since 1998 Associate Attending Physician, Swedish Covenant Hospital, Chicago, since 2000 and Attending Physician at North Shore Hospital in Evanston, Illinois since 2001.

Through his professional writings and lectures, he has addressed a variety of topics pertaining to cardiology, preventive cardiology, heart health, and the role of the internist in promoting heart health.

275 Trump sought release of secret Nunes memo, putting him at odds with Justice Department - Chicago Tribune On Wednesday, as Republicans were clamoring to make public a secret document they think will undercut the investigation into Russian meddling, President Donald Trump made clear his desire: Release the memo.Trumps directive was at odds with his own Justice Department, which had warned that releasing the classified memo written by congressional Republicans would be extraordinarily reckless without an official review. Nevertheless, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly relayed the presidents view to Attorney General Jeff Sessions  although the decision to release the document ultimately lies with Congress.Kelly and Sessions spoke twice that day  in person during a smallgroup afternoon meeting and over the phone later that evening  and Kelly conveyed Trumps desire, a senior administration official said.Trump and his Republican allies have placed special emphasis on the classified memo, which was written by staff members for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, RCalif., and suggests that the FBI may have relied on politically motivated or questionable sources to justify its request for a secret surveillance warrant in the investigations early phase. Democrats have characterized the memo as misleading talking points designed to smear the FBI. They said it inaccurately summarizes investigative materials that also are classified.Trump is inclined to have that released just because it will shed light, said a senior administration official who was speaking on the condition of anonymity to recount private conversations. Apparently all the rumors are that it will shed light, it will help the investigators come to a conclusion.The intervention with Sessions, which has not previously been reported, marked another example of the presidents yearlong attempts to shape and influence an investigation that is fundamentally outside his control. Trump, appearing frustrated and at times angry, has complained to confidants and aides in recent weeks that he does not understand why he cannot simply give orders to my guys at what he sometimes calls the Trump Justice Department, two people familiar with the presidents comments said.Such complaints, and Trumps repeated attempts to pressure senior law enforcement officials through firings or other means, have now become one of the main focuses of the investigation  including Trumps order last summer to fire special counsel Robert Mueller III, which prompted White House counsel Donald McGahn to threaten to quit before Trump backed down.Trump recently revived his complaints that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was not properly supervising Muellers probe, and suggested that he should fire Rosenstein  a highly controversial action against the person officially overseeing the special counsels investigation, an adviser who speaks frequently with Trump said.The president also made clear in recent days that he hopes that new questions facing the investigation allow him or his associates to make changes at the Justice Department, two people familiar with Trumps comments said.J. Scott Applewhite  AP House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, RCalif., returns to a secure area in the Capitol where his panel is interviewing former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon as part of its ongoing Russia investigation, in Washington, Jan. 16, 2018.House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, RCalif., returns to a secure area in the Capitol where his panel is interviewing former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon as part of its ongoing Russia investigation, in Washington, Jan. 16, 2018.J. Scott Applewhite  AP The president has told close advisers that the memo is starting to make people realize how the FBI and the Mueller probe are biased against him, and that it could provide him with grounds for either firing or forcing Rosenstein to leave, according to one person familiar with his remarks. He has privately derided Rosenstein as the Democrat from Baltimore. Rosenstein is not a Democrat. He was appointed as a U.S. attorney in Maryland by President George W. Bush and was kept in that post by President Barack Obama.One senior White House official said he personally had not heard the president make comments about getting rid of Rosenstein, which were first reported by CNN.A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.As Mueller narrows his probe  homing in on the ways Trump may have tried to impede the Russia investigation  a common thread ties many of the incidents together: a president accustomed to functioning as the executive of a private family business who does not seem to understand that his subordinates have sworn an oath to the Constitution rather than to him.On Wednesday, speaking briefly to reporters, Trump defended his actions in the probe as fighting back against unfair allegations. Oh, well, Did he fight back  Trump said. You fight back, Oh, its obstruction. The Russia probe has also figured prominently in Trumps souring relationships with some former allies and confidants. Trump first became enraged with Sessions after the attorney general recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation, which Trump thinks led to the appointment of Mueller. Later, after his former chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, accused Trumps eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and soninlaw, Jared Kushner, of a treasonous and unpatriotic meeting with a Russian lawyer in a new book, the furious president cast Bannon out of his orbit, as well.Sally Yates, the acting attorney general whom Trump fired early last year for failing to enforce his travel ban, said in an interview that Trumps behavior  from his June decision to call for Muellers firing to other meddling throughout the year  is beyond unusual and really dangerous.Karoun Demirjian Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have drafted a document they say will counter Republican efforts to discredit the FBI probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.The panels top Democrat, Adam Schiff , Calif., intends to ask the panel Monday to allow all House members...Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have drafted a document they say will counter Republican efforts to discredit the FBI probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.The panels top Democrat, Adam Schiff , Calif., intends to ask the panel Monday to allow all House members...Karoun Demirjian If you get to whats most essential and important and, I think, really damaging to our country, beyond just the confines of this administration, its this attack on our democratic institutions and particularly the Department of Justice, she said. It is a firm tradition at the Department of Justice that the White House just has absolutely no involvement in criminal investigations or prosecutions, period.She added: It seems like there are almost weekly efforts to try to get DOJ to open up a case on his former political rival. . . . The near daily attacks on the FBI  weve never seen anything anywhere close to this before.Indeed, Trump has shown a repeated pattern of attempting to regain control of the Russia investigation and deploy the Justice Department for his own protection and personal gain  comments and actions Muellers team could include in the obstructionofjustice portion of their probe.The problem, said Barry Bennett, a former senior adviser on the Trump campaign, is that subordinates sometimes confuse Trumps angry venting for actual administration directives.Some people still either dont understand the difference between the presidents bark and his bite, or theyre more than willing to take advantage of the bark to assume that it was a bite, Bennett said. Trust me, everybody on the campaign was fired more than once, but it never really happened.The arc of a potential case of obstruction of justice stretches back to the earliest days of Trumps presidency.In January 2017, at a oneonone dinner, thenFBI Director James Comey said, Trump told him: I need loyalty. I expect loyalty. A month later, in February, Trump dismissed others from the Oval Office and told Comey that Michael Flynn  Trumps former national security adviser who was fired for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russians  had done nothing wrong, according to Comeys testimony to Congress.I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go, Trump said at the time, according to Comey. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.Then, in phone calls in March and April, Trump told Comey that he needed him to lift the cloud of the Russia investigation and get out that Trump personally was not under investigation.And then on May 9, an angry Trump finally fired the FBI director.Shortly after dismissing Comey, the president asked Andrew McCabe, his acting FBI director, whom he voted for in the 2016 election, according to people with knowledge of the conversation. In December, when The Washington Post reported that McCabe intended to retire in early 2018 once he becomes fully eligible for his pension benefits, Trump took to Twitter to criticize him.A person who has spoken with Muellers team said investigators questions seemed at least partially designed to probe potential obstruction from Trump.The questions are about who was where in every meeting, what happened before and after, what the president was saying as he made decisions, this person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to recount a private session.This person added that while it seemed unlikely Muellers team would yield any evidence of a coordinated effort to aid the Russians  If you were on the campaign, you know we couldnt even collude with ourselves, he said  the investigators might find more details to support obstruction of justice.Rosalind S.

Helderman, Josh Dawsey By June, Trump had so openly begun discussing firing Mueller that Bannon and Reince Priebus, who was then chief of staff, grew incredibly concerned, huddling to strategize about how to dissuade the president and enlisting others to intervene with him.In midJune, Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of the conservative Newsmax Media and a longtime Trump confidant, voiced those concerns publicly, telling PBS NewsHour, I think hes perhaps terminating the special counsel.And that same month, Trump did, in fact, order McGahn to fire Mueller, a directive first reported Thursday by the New York Times. But McGahn told West Wing staff  though not the president  that he would quit before carrying out Trumps directive, and the president ultimately backed down, people familiar with the events said.Allies of the president said that his demands for absolute loyalty are not unreasonable  and not indicative of any attempts to obstruct justice. Of course the president ought to be able to expect loyalty, said Newt Gingrich, an unofficial Trump adviser. He is the chosen president of the United States by the American people, and he is the chief executive. If theyre not loyal to him, who the hell are they supposed to be loyal toIn recent weeks, Muellers team has questioned White House staff about the June episode in which Trump expressed interest in firing Mueller, a person familiar with those interviews said.Mueller has also asked about Trumps repeated outbursts against his attorney general, including a moment in late July when Trump nearly ousted Sessions out of anger at the Russia probe. Although McGahn had called Sessions at Trumps request in early March to urge him not to recuse himself, Sessions stepped aside that same day  and the president was furious.By July 19, Trump was venting publicly, telling the Times that it was very unfair of Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia investigation and that he would not have nominated Sessions to be attorney general if he had known of his plans.The next day, facing Trumps public criticism, Sessions announced that he would remain attorney general as long as it is appropriate. That same day, a White House adviser told a Post reporter that Trump was stunned that Sessions had not yet quit. The president, this adviser added, has been hoping that Sessions would be embarrassed enough by Trumps scathing public remarks to leave on his own.Shortly after, Trump issued a directive to Priebus: Go to Sessions and secure his resignation, according to two people with knowledge of the episode.But Priebus hesitated, declining to outright ask Sessions to quit and instead working to manage Trumps anger, those two people said. In the following days, Republicans rallied to Sessions defense, and Trump backed off.A person who has interacted with Muellers team said the prosecutors seem to be pursuing a theory that Trumps actions over months have followed a consistent pattern. Their theory appears to be that he goes after people who are not loyal, this person said. He wants in place people who are loyal, to make sure he doesnt get in trouble in the investigation.Karoun Demirjian, Josh Dawsey and Craig Timberg Top Democrats on Tuesday called on Facebook and Twitter to investigate what lawmakers said are Russian efforts to promote the release of a classified Republican memo criticizing the FBI probe of Russias meddling in the 2016 campaign.ReleaseTheMemo and other hashtags have been trending on Twitter...Top Democrats on Tuesday called on Facebook and Twitter to investigate what lawmakers said are Russian efforts to promote the release of a classified Republican memo criticizing the FBI probe of Russias meddling in the 2016 campaign.ReleaseTheMemo and other hashtags have been trending on Twitter...Karoun Demirjian, Josh Dawsey and Craig Timberg This person added that key episodes in this narrative include Trumps order that Sessions not recuse himself from the investigation the firing of Comey his efforts to intervene to get the Flynn investigation dropped and then, above all, Trumps dictation aboard Air Force One in July of a misleading statement to be released by his son, Don Jr., about his meeting with the Russian lawyer at Trump Tower during the campaign  the most obvious obstructive act, this person said.To prove obstruction of justice, Mueller would have to show that Trump didnt just act to derail the investigation but did so with a corrupt motive, such as an effort to hide his own misdeeds. Legal experts are divided over whether the Constitution allows for the president to be indicted while in office. As a result, Mueller might seek to outline his findings about Trumps actions in a written report rather than bring them in court through criminal charges. It would probably fall to Rosenstein to decide whether to submit the report to Congress, which has the power to open impeachment proceedings.As Trump faced growing questions about myriad concerns from his June directive to fire Mueller to his more recent grousing about Rosenstein, the White House was largely silent. In response to several specific queries, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley offered a written statement that addressed few of them.The president has been clear publicly and privately that he wants absolute transparency throughout this process, Gidley said in the statement. Based on numerous news reports, top officials at the FBI have engaged in conduct that shows bias against President Trump and bias for Hillary Clinton.

281 Illinois Newspapers Illinois Newspapers Newspapers can be a valuable resource because they often publish marriage, divorce, death, and funeral notices as well as obituaries. The notices may include names, including maiden names and parent names, dates, and places. Death notices and obituaries often name living relatives. Newspapers also publish articles of local interest that often cover religious and social events in the community and include the names of people involved. Some newspapers serve several communities and devote columns to the everyday happenings in the area. They also include legal notices, estate sales, and advertising for local businesses. One strategy for using newspapers in research, is to select a time period for which your ancestor lived and begin by looking for obituaries as well as birth, marriage, and death notices. Read all the articles which were generated in the county where your ancestor lived, especially articles which give information about the church and schools where your ancestor may have attended.

282 NCAA denies Notre Dame&amp;apos;s appeal of 21 vacated football wins from 2011-12 - Chicago Tribune Notre Dame s president released a scathing criticism Tuesday of the NCAA s denial of the schools appeal to have 21 football victories from 2012 and 2013 restored.The Irish must vacate 12 wins from 2012  the season in which they appeared in the BCS title game  and nine from 2013 because of academic misconduct after a ruling by the NCAA Division I Infractions Appeals Committee.We are deeply disappointed by and strongly disagree with the denial of the universitys appeal, the Rev. John I. Jenkins, Notre Dames president, wrote in a statement. Our concerns go beyond the particulars of our case and the record of two football seasons to the academic autonomy of our institutions, the integrity of college athletics and the ability of the NCAA to achieve its fundamental purpose.A school investigation into academic dishonesty before the 2014 season led to the suspensions of former players KeiVarae Russell, DaVaris Daniels, Ishaq Williams, Eilar Hardy and Kendall Moore. Hardy returned later that season, and Russell returned for the 2015 season.The NCAA originally announced its penalties  which included one year of probation and a 5,000 fine along with the vacated victories  in a Nov. 22, 2016, ruling by the Committee on Infractions. The panel said a former Notre Dame student trainer violated NCAA ethical conduct rules when she committed academic misconduct for two football studentathletes and provided six other football studentathletes with impermissible academic extra benefits.Notre Dame appealed the penalty of vacated victories shortly thereafter.In its ruling announced Tuesday, the appeals committee said that the panel had the authority under NCAA rules to prescribe penalties for academic misconduct violations, that it confirmed at the time of the violations, the athletic training student was considered a university employee under NCAA rules, and that imposition of the vacation of wins would not have been an abuse of discretion given the other violations.Jenkins took issue on several fronts.In academic misconduct cases, the penalty of vacation of team records has, until now, only been applied in the case of serious forms of institutional culpability: when coaches, administrators or persons with academic responsibilities are complicit in cheating, or when an institution fails to monitor or lacks control over its athletics program, Jenkins wrote.In Notre Dames case, two of the students had received assistance from a fulltime undergraduate student who had parttime employment as an assistant to our athletic trainers. Studenttostudent cheating is not normally within the NCAAs jurisdiction, but the NCAA concluded that the students role as a parttime assistant trainer made her a representative of the institution and justified a vacation of team records penalty in this case.Jenkins wrote that the committee didnt explain why it viewed the student trainer as an institutional representative.This is more disturbing given that, in 2016, the member institutions of the NCAA amended the academic misconduct rules to make clear that students who serve in roles identical to that of the student in our case would not be considered institutional representatives, Jenkins wrote. If the committee members chose to depart both from precedent and the position adopted by the NCAA membership, it was incumbent on them to offer an explanation. They did not.Jenkins also wrote that the NCAA lacked rational explanation while addressing the three players ruled ineligible while competing.When these studentathletes competed in 2012 and 2013, the university correctly certified to the NCAA that they were eligible to compete, Jenkins wrote. After the cheating was discovered and the cases adjudicated by the University Honesty Committee in 2014, a framework was painstakingly created to recalculate grades so that students understood the consequences of their actions and did not benefit from them. In the curious logic of the NCAA, however, it is precisely the application of our Honor Code that is the source of the vacation of wins penalty, for the recalculation of the grades in 2014 led to the three studentathletes being deemed ineligible retroactively.To impose a severe penalty for this retroactive ineligibility establishes a dangerous precedent and turns the seminal concept of academic autonomy on its head.Although he didnt directly name North Carolina, Jenkins later referenced another recent highprofile academic misconduct case.The notion that a universitys exercise of academic autonomy can under NCAA rules lead to exoneration  or to a severe penalty  without regard to the way in which it is used defies logic and any notion of fundamental fairness, Jenkins wrote.Jenkins asked the NCAA to work with institutions to establish policies to address academic dishonesty and reform its enforcement process to provide a level of transparency, consistency and fairness that it currently lacks.What is at stake here is the academic autonomy of our institutions and the integrity of college athletics, Jenkins wrote.lpope@posttrib.comTwitter @lamondpopeRich history helps Notre Dame land fourstar receiver Kevin Austin Notre Dame signing day recap: 27player class ranks 10th nationally What is Loyola basketballs Wall of Culture Its a guide to the teams remarkable season.

284 Mayor pushes for Springfield to annex Illinois State Fairgrounds Mayor pushes for Springfield to annex Illinois State Fairgrounds Friday Feb 2, 2018 at 7:08 AM Feb 2, 2018 at 10:27 AM   Springfield Mayor Jim Langfelder is lobbying local legislators to let the city annex the State Fairgrounds and use some city sales tax revenue generated there to make repairs to several of the 170 buildings. The Coliseum, which normally hosts horse shows yearround, has been closed since October 2016 after structural damage to its roof made it unsafe for use. Building 29 and Barn 38 are closed, as well, and it was announced in January that Barn 13 needed emergency repairs. Langfelder said local lodging establishments have told him that canceling horse shows has meant a 25 percent reduction to their business. He bemoaned the domino effect on local shops and restaurants, as well. Once you lose the horse shows, its hard to get them back, Langfelder said. Its absolutely an economic hit for us. Eventually, with grounds annexed into the city, it would be able to switch over City Water, Light and Power as its utility, which would mean technicians close by if there were any outages, Langfelder added. Budget director Bill McCarty said in 2015, just special events on the state fairgrounds generated about 146,000 in sales taxes for Sangamon County, according to information the city received from the state Department of Revenue via a Freedom of Information Act request. The city already gets about 100,000 from the state to pay for fire protection for the grounds, he added. Repairs to the 101yearold building could cost up to 3.7 million, according to a 2016 report by Hillsboro engineering firm HurstRosche. To install airconditioning and heating capabilities could be about another 3 million, according to Illinois Fairgrounds Foundation Board chair John Slayton. Gov. Bruce Rauner created the foundation the same year the Coliseum closed to raise private funds for repairs. Slayton said the foundation has raised about 30,000 so far, though none of it has been awarded to either the fairgrounds in Springfield or Du Quoin. He added that the foundation is close to finalizing a deal on naming rights to the coliseum that will provide it with the capital it needs to be fixed. Slayton said the foundation hasnt taken a stance on Langfelders idea, though he said that the foundation and the governor have fixing the Coliseum as their No. 1 priority. There is about 180 million backlog of maintenance repairs for both fairgrounds, he said. There are 170 buildings out there and each one needs some kind of repair, Slayton said. The Du Quoin State Fairgrounds were annexed into the city of Du Quoin in 1972. However, the move was prior to state ownership, according to Morgan Booth, Illinois State Fairgrounds spokesperson. State Rep. Tim Butler, RSpringfield, said he would need more details before he could make a judgment on Langfelders proposal. Im open to all sorts of ideas, Butler said. ... Specifically for this idea of annexing the fairgrounds into the city, you need everyone at the table talking about it  the county, the city and the state. Other ideas on Langfelders wish list include the legislature granting Springfield an exemption to a state law that only allows changes in tax collection at the beginning of January and June. Langfelder wants the state to let Springfield begin collecting increased sales tax and telecommunication taxes in March, if aldermen pass either measure. The city is facing a possible 11.5 million budget hole, and three months worth of increased sales tax is about 1.2 million. Butler said he told Langfelder in a meeting that pushing up the increased tax collection implementation date from June to March wasnt viable. Its a large ask of the members of the General Assembly to go on the record for a tax increase for one municipality during an election year, Butler said.   Never

287 Illinois Democratic congressman faces challenge from left LA GRANGE, Ill. AP  A Lipinski has represented whats now Illinois 3rd congressional district since U.S. Rep. Dan Lipinskis father was first elected more than three decades ago. Now the younger Lipinski, a seventerm incumbent known as one of Congress most conservative Democrats, is facing a tougherthanusual primary challenge from the left flank of his party.Political newcomer Marie Newman says Lipinski, who opposes abortion and voted against President Barack Obamas 2010 health care overhaul, no longer reflects the Chicagoarea district, which supported Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primary.Newman has the backing of abortion rights and progressive groups and some of Lipinskis Democratic colleagues, including U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, as Newman looks to end what shes dubbed the Lipinski monarchy.Folks are fed up, and were going to make a change, right now, the small business owner from LaGrange said during a recent campaign stop. She pledged to represent trueblue Democrats by pushing for a 15 minimum wage, health care for all and protections for immigrants and refugees.Lipinski says hes worked hard for the district, which includes parts of Chicagos southwest side and suburbs including LaGrange and Brookfield, helping bring better jobs and transportation dollars. He notes its earned him support from labor organizations including the Illinois AFLCIO, which has about 1,500 affiliated unions statewide, though the Illinois chapter of the Service Employees International Union backed Newman.Im not just a show horse. Im a workhorse, he said. My constituents understand that because of that, Ive been able to deliver for them.The March 20 primary is one of several races nationwide this year in which progressives are targeting longtime Democratic incumbents. In New York, lawyer and businessman Suraj Patel, who worked on President Barack Obamas presidential campaigns, is trying to unseat Rep. Carolyn Maloney, who was first elected in 1992. Bostonbased software developer Brianna Wu, who spoke out about harassment of women in the tech industry during what became known as GamerGate, is running against eightterm Rep. Stephen Lynch.Many challengers, like Newman, say they were inspired to run after seeing people mobilize against the policies of President Donald Trump, or because theyre frustrated by the Democratic establishment.Lipinski describes the movement as a tea party of the left. He says the challenges  and an insistence that all Democrats must be in liberal lockstep on issues  is dividing Democrats and could ultimately hurt the party and its ability to regain control of the House this fall.He says that while his district has voted reliably Democratic, that could change if someone who is too liberal is elected.In 2016, the district supported Clinton with 55 percent over Trumps 40 percent  the lowest margin of any Chicagoarea congressional district represented by a Democrat. The same was true in 2012 and 2008.We really need to be united in fighting against President Trump, Lipinski said. If were focused inwards within our own party, that really prevents us from working to try to stop what president trump is doing.Newman isnt buying it.There is no tea party of the left, she says. There are trueblue Democrats that are trying to get democracy back in place.Defeating Lipinski wont be easy. His name is entrenched in the area, where his father was first elected congressman in 1982. William Lipinski served until 2004, when he stepped down after the primary, allowing Democratic Party leaders to put his son on the general election ballot in his place.Dan Lipinski won just more than half the vote in his first two primaries, with the other votes split between two other candidates in 2006 and three others in 2008. Since then hes either run unopposed or won every contested election by wide margins.This year the only person running in the GOP primary is an outspoken Holocaust denier.The Illinois Republican Party, which had unsuccessfully tried to recruit a candidate, denounced selfproclaimed Nazi Arthur Jones but determined it couldnt get him removed from the ballot. The party is now encouraging people to run as independents or writein candidates.Follow Sara Burnett on Twitter: https:twitter.comsara_burnett 
288 Pierce stays on pace: Coleman, North Chicago keep rolling in conference - Lake County News-Sun Coming off a big conference win Tuesday against Grayslake Central, it would have been understandable if North Chicago had a letdown in its next game.Pierce Coleman made sure that wouldnt be the case Friday against Antioch.The senior guard scored 28 points, leading the Warhawks to a 7846 Northern Lake County victory against the visiting Sequoits.It was all about teamwork, Coleman said.

I told him, I know you can score 20 points, I need you to stop somebody.

296 Illinois agency picks Boston company for opioid helpline Illinois agency picks Boston company for opioid helpline 12618 12:51 PM BELLEVILLE, Ill.  The Illinois Department of Human Services has hired a Bostonbased company to run an opioid help hotline, despite receiving proposals from at least three Illinois providers. Gov. Bruce Rauner announced plans for the hotline last year. Its part of the states effort to combat the opioid epidemic. The 1.2 million program is being paid for through a federal grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The department searched for a provider that could operate the hotline at all hours every day and could handle 30,000 calls a year, the Belleville NewsDemocrat reported. Chicagobased Caritas, Chicagoarea nonprofit PilsenLittle Village Community Mental Health Center and the Iroquois Mental Health Center in eastern Illinois were among those that submitted proposals. But the state agency opted to go with Bostonbased Health Resources in Action. In their proposals, the agencies listed how much of the hotline budget would be allocated to personnel, fringe benefits, hotline equipment and other expenses. Health Resources in Actions said it would spend more than 515,000 to develop and maintain the hotline system by Texasbased Nebulogic Technologies. Health Resources in Action also planned a 65,000 marketing and communications budget and is working with the Public Health Institute of Metropolitan Chicago to promote the opioid hotline. Spokesman Patrick Laughlin said the department chose a vendor that didnt have a conflict of interest when referring individuals to treatment. Its imperative that the helpline remains impartial when referring individuals to treatment, and this aspect may have limited the number of Illinois organizations interested in responding to the request for proposals, said Laughlin. The hotline is available 24 hours a day. Its received 1,000 calls since starting.

297 Bulls&amp;apos; youth movement begins in earnest with Cristiano Felicio and David Nwaba given starting roles - Chicago Tribune Robin Lopez , Justin Holiday and Jerian Grant are out. Cristiano Felicio , David Nwaba and Cameron Payne are in.And the Bulls  rebuild remains centered on Zach LaVine , Kris Dunn and Lauri Markkanen.Thats the gist of executive vice president John Paxson s message to both his team and reporters before Tuesdays first postAllStar break practice at Advocate Center.Call it player development. Call it tanking. Call it both or whatever you want.To Paxson, its called good business for the final 25 games.You cant play 12 guys in our game. Nine or 10 is the most. And its just the position were in as a young team, 2037, with a lot of young guys and several who we havent really had the chance to see play much this year, Paxson said. For us to make the proper evaluation in terms of who fits us moving forward, this is something we have to do.Felicio and Nwaba will start alongside Dunn, LaVine and Markkanen on Thursday against the 76ers and, in Paxsons words, for a sufficient time moving forward, though he called the situation fluid. Payne will play backup point guard to Dunn over Grant, who will sit. Lopez and Holiday also will be cheerleading.Having played, I was out of the rotation several times. I know what its like to be asked to take a lesser role, Paxson said. Players have pride. So its hard. I dont take that lightly at all.But we have to look at the big picture. And thats what were doing. Its not easy as players. But one thing Ive been impressed by with this group all year is theyve bonded together, they like one another and they support one another. I dont see that changing.Paxson cited the development of Bobby Portis and Denzel Valentine as examples of what can happen when young players are given consistent minutes and opportunity. Nevertheless, Felicio has regressed this season and Paynes forcefed rotational turn last season fared poorly.What you hope for from a player standpoint is they gain some confidence in who they are, get comfortable on the floor and play well. I still think we have a lot of really good young talent, Paxson said. I think the exciting thing for us is for the first time were going to have a healthy Zach, Lauri and Kris. Theyre obviously the core.Along those lines, Paxson said he planned to talk to LaVine and the Bulls medical team about LaVine possibly playing the second leg of backtoback games. The Bulls have four more such sets.And both Paxson and Hoiberg said Dunn no longer would be on the 20minute limit that marked his lone game before the break following his 11game absence with a concussion. Hoiberg added the Bulls would be smart about Dunns usage in the initial postbreak games.As for Payne, who underwent surgery for the second time on a bone in his right foot last September, Paxson said the goal is simple.Especially when youre running with the second unit and the way Fred wants to play, play with pace, defend your position, compete every night and stay within yourself, Paxson said. His role is to get us into offense quickly and efficiently and make the right play with the ball. You dont want to be a high turnover guy.He got some G League games in, which was helpful for his conditioning. But he hasnt played basketball for a long time. And just as we talked about with Zach, there are going to be some ups and downs. Guys have to play through mistakes. But Cam has to run our team. We saw once Kris Dunn got his confidence and swagger back, he did a great job of running our team. Thats what Cam has to do in a backup role.Hoiberg is an organizational guy who has embraced his role in the rebuild following the trade of Jimmy Butler. Nevertheless, hes now in a position where, unlike most coaches, hes being told by management whom to play.I understand where we are right now as an organization, Hoiberg said. From my standpoint, it doesnt change our approach. And thats the important message to our players. We have to have great practices and great competition and play extremely hard once we step on the floor.Were going to try to put a game plan together to give our team an opportunity to compete to win. That doesnt change.kcjohnson@chicagotribune.comTwitter @kcjhoopBulls standard of play for stretch run remains same regardless of personnel That time Kobe Bryant almost became a Bull  the first time Bulls rookie Lauri Markkanen caps AllStar weekend with runnerup skills finish Seven things about NBCs Olympics coverage, including an idea for Scott Hamilton Sorry Elizabeth Swaney, Olympics should be reserved for the best athletes Bears decline 2018 option on guard Josh Sitton, who says he has prime years left in his career Privacy Policy Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Kris Dunn Chicago Bulls Cristiano Felicio Zach LaVine Jerian Grant Kobe Bryant John Paxson

299 &amp;apos;How does one airline run out of de-icer?&amp;apos;: Some gripes at Midway after Southwest&amp;apos;s cancellations - Chicago Tribune Midway Airport was abuzz Monday with harried Southwest Airlines passengers trying to get their destinations a day after hundreds were stranded when the Dallasbased airline canceled all flights due to trouble deicing planes.Seats were still hard to come by as passengers scrambled to rebook flights.More than 250 flights were canceled Sunday after the airline ran short of glycol, the fluid used to deice aircraft, and a pump on one of the glycol tanks failed, Southwest spokeswoman Lisa Tiller said in an emailed statement.The glycol has been replenished and the airport deicing equipment is fully functional, Tiller said. Mondays clear skies would also help the airline operate more than 250 flights out of Midway, she added. Southwest apologized to passengers for the inconvenience.Tiller declined to be specific about what measures were being taken to accommodate passengers, but she said that while Southwest doesnt typically offer gestures of goodwill as a result of weatherrelated events, the large number of cancellations in this case has the airline making additional considerations for impacted customers.Some passengers were frustrated, while others were philosophical about their unexpected extra day in Chicago.Nicole Riordan, was trying to get back to her Phoenix home after flying in Thursday for a birthday celebration with family and friends.The Oak Lawn native found out her flight was canceled Sunday when she checked her app just hours before she was set to depart.Riordan was puzzled by the reason for the cancellation. How does one airline run out of deicer Riordan said. That was a little upsetting.A student at West Coast Ultrasound Institute, Riordan said she missed classes Monday because of the flight cancellation.Her return journey could have been even rougher  and more expensive.Riordan first rebooked a return flight leaving Monday evening  with a stop in Denver  that would have gotten her home past midnight. She tried again and found an afternoon flight but said Southwest then hit her with a 100 change fee. She protested and the airline waived it.Jackie Potvin wasnt so lucky.In town from Westport, Mass., with her daughter and friends for a gymnastics competition at Navy Pier, she ended up paying 200 a night to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn near Midway and then spending 308 to book two tickets for herself and her 14yearold daughter on a JetBlue flight Monday so they didnt miss an extra day of school and work. If they would have given us a hotel voucher, it wouldnt have hit too hard, Potvin said. But when you have to spend another 400plus when it has nothing to do with the weather  Im not too happy with Southwest.But aviation consultant Michael Boyd noted that Southwests deicing debacle was likely a oneoff event that could only be blamed on Mother Nature.A little bit of ice will take an airplane out of the sky, Boyd said, so airlines are extra cautious when they run out of fluid. An airline can only store so much glycol at the airport, and the combination of several days of snowy weather and a mechanical malfunction exacerbated the problem for Southwest, he said.With Southwest being the largest carrier at Midway, it makes sense that the airline would be facing the debacle rather than smaller airlines who dont have as many flights coming in and out of the South Side airport, Boyd said.Its hard to anticipate this, he said. Its not like you can go to the deicing store and fill up. Today airlines take no chances.This is the second time this winter that Southwest has run into deicing problems.A few days after Christmas, 90 Southwest Airlines flights were canceled due to delays caused by the deicing of planes, according to a statement from the airline at the time. The airline blamed freezing conditions at the airport for slowing down crews in charge of deicing the planes.crshropshire@chicagotribune.comrchannick@chicagotribune.comkdouglas@chicagotribune.comTwitter @ corilynsRELATEDDeicing delays blamed for cancellation of nearly 90 flights at Midway Chicago records 9 straight days of snowfall, matching record 4 dead after shoveling, blowing or plowing snow in Lake County, Indiana John Hancock Center skyscraper losing its iconic name Land of Nod closes nearly all its stores, including 3 in Illinois Which city has the degree and talent edge for Amazons second headquarters Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Southwest Airlines
300 Dubuque Champps to close; Old Chicago to open Dubuque Champps to close Old Chicago to open BY JEFF MONTGOMERY jeff.montgomery@thmedia.com Save Champps Americana in Dubuque will close its doors this spring, and an Old Chicago restaurant will open in that space weeks later. Champps opened within the Best Western Plus, 3100 Dodge St., in 2008. The restaurant and bar will close at some point in April, according to Frontier Hospitality Group coowner Dan Huber. The group owns  and will continue to own  the Dodge Street property. Huber said Dubuquebased ROC Taproom purchased the assets of Champps and will convert the space into an Old Chicago restaurant. Founded in 1976, Old Chicago specializes in Chicagostyle pizzas, taproom classics and craft beer. It has more than 100 restaurants in 22 states. Huber said there are many similarities between Champps and Old Chicago, but he believes that the latter offers a particularly strong draftbeer selection, loyalty program and menu. In general, I think it is a stronger, more wellsupported concept nationally, Huber said. I think it will be very, very popular in Dubuque. He said just shy of 100 employees work at Champps. There will be no layoffs, and all employees will be hired at their current wage rate, Huber said. ROC Taproom acquired its first four Old Chicago locations in July, according to President Jeff Ruppel. It now owns four such restaurants in Iowa and one each in Illinois and Indiana. Ruppel is also the president of Parco Ltd., which owns 29 Wendys restaurants in Iowa, Illinois and Minnesota. He said he thinks area residents will quickly take a liking to Old Chicago menu items such as Italian nachos and Chicagostyle pizza. He hopes the restaurant also will tap into the areas interest in beer. We consider ourselves the beer authority and offer a great selection of beerfriendly food, Ruppel said. I think Dubuque is a perfect place for the restaurant, and I think people will be excited about it. The restaurant space will be closed for about three weeks when the new tenant makes renovations and trains staff on the new restaurant concept. The facility is in really great shape, but there still are some changes we need to make, Ruppel said. We are going to polish things up, put in some new furniture and change up the color schemes. The biggest thing will be revamping the kitchen to get in the equipment we need. Huber said the initial terms of the lease are for 10 years and the agreement could extend as far as 25 years. He noted that all events in banquet rooms within the hotel will be unaffected by the restaurant change. All gift cards to Champps will be honored by Old Chicago. The announcement of Champps impending closure comes just days before the restaurant chains 10th anniversary in Dubuque. Huber acknowledged that many customers will miss the restaurant, but he said the future of the space will be even brighter. Champps has had a terrific run and has been very well supported by the community, he said. It is fair to say it is one of the more popular restaurants in the Dubuque area. We caught a great wave with Champps, and we are hoping to catch an even bigger one with Old Chicago. Copyright, Telegraph Herald.

I am very scared due to my parents begging me not to go, saying how dangerous it is, and I have very little support. I am also sheltered, having grown up in suburban Florida. I was wondering if there is any Korean center to join, and if the city is as dangerous as everyone says it is I am a 52 girl, and very nervous Im actually from Chicago and Ive lived in various parts of the city. There are some areas where there is more intercommunal violence and also over policing but most parts are safe. If you think about how many people are in the city and the number of crimes that happen, its really not as dangerous as people make it out to be. People only really report the negative news because thats what gets ratings. From what I know, Ravenswood is a very quiet and lowkey neighborhood. Just dont do things like walk through alleyways and make sure to pay attention to your surroundings and youll be fine.I dont know about Korean centers but I think there is a part of the city that has a higher Korean population.

302 &amp;apos;Serial stowaway&amp;apos; grows agitated after judge orders a mental evaluation - Chicago Tribune The Chicagoarea woman who has earned national notoriety as a stowaway for sneaking onto jets without a ticket grew agitated Wednesday in court following her arrest for the second time in two weeks.The outburst by Marilyn Hartman, 66, came moments after a judge granted Cook County prosecutors request to evaluate her sanity and mental fitness to stand trial on felony theft charges.No I dont Hartman protested loudly, shaking her head, when her lawyer said Hartman had a family in answer to a question from Judge Adam Bourgeois Jr.When Bourgeois then asked if Hartman was under the care of a medical professional, her attorney, Parle RoeTaylor, began to say no, but Hartman, dressed in a jail uniform with an oversized jacket, again interrupted, crying out, YesHartman is being held without bail after she was arrested at OHare International Airport early Sunday after authorities spotted her in Terminal 3, just two days after a judge repeatedly ordered her to stay away from the airport. She was charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing and violating her bail bond.Earlier this month, Hartman managed to get past British Airways ticket agents and a Customs and Border Protection officer, boarded a jet without a ticket and flew to Londons Heathrow Airport in an empty seat.Hartmans court appearance Wednesday marked her fourth in just two weeks.After court, RoeTaylor vowed to seek an alternative to Cook County Jail for Hartman. She also told reporters that Hartman indeed has family members who did not attend court Wednesday.I do not believe she belongs in the criminal justice system, but here we are, RoeTaylor said. What I know is that the traditional way weve handled this case hasnt been the most successful, so perhaps we need to look at it differently.Hartman is scheduled to appear in court in midFebruary.The two recent arrests mark Hartmans first in Chicago since 2016, but she has a long history of trying to sneak onto airplanes.Hartman was given probation when she originally was sentenced after pleading guilty to a February 2016 trespassing charge, but she was sentenced to 364 days in jail a few weeks later, according to court records.At the time, Hartman had been living at a mental health facility on the Near North Side before violating the terms of her probation by leaving the facility and going to OHare.Hartman has been detained several times across the country for trying to bypass airport security.In a court filing after her arrest in July 2015 at OHare on trespass charges, Cook County prosecutors described Hartman as a serial stowaway.mcrepeau@chicagotribune.comRELATED:Serial stowaway arrested at OHare days after judge bans her from airport Serial stowaway sneaks onto OHare plane, flies to London: cops Serial stowaway gets 2 years probation, 6 months at mental health facility Chicago police commander gunned down in Loop pursuing a suspect Slain Chicago cop advocated for stiffer sentences suspect in his shooting is a 4time felon New York Times hired, then quickly unhired, writer who tweeted about befriending neoNazis Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Trials and Arbitration OHare International Airport London Heathrow Airport

314 Slain Chicago Police Commander Was 31-Year Veteran Who Joined A Foot Chase Without Hesitation Chicago Police Commander Paul Bauers final act in a decorated career was to join fellow officers in a foot pursuit through the heart of his downtown district.Bauer, a 31year police department veteran, was shot and killed Tuesday afternoon while attempting to detain a suspect who was being pursued by a tactical team in the Chicago Loop. The commander, who happened to be in the area for a meeting, immediately responded to radio calls that a suspect was on the run nearby.Details of the incident remain unclear, but Chicago police say Bauer encountered the suspect in a stairwell outside the Thompson Center, a Loop office building that houses Illinois state government offices. A struggle ensued, and Bauer was shot multiple times.As news of Bauers killing spread, shocked colleagues mourned the loss of a veteran commander known as a steady leader who deftly handled the pressure of commanding police in the citys highest profile district. Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson offered condolences Tuesday night to officers under Bauers command.He was an individual defined by his decency and his sense of duty. He loved his family, he loved the Police Department, he loved the neighborhood of Bridgeport and he loved the city of Chicago, Emanuel said, according to the Chicago Tribune . I ask each of us, in the days ahead, if you see Chicagos officers doing their job, reach out to them as a member of your family. Thank them.Police took the suspect, who has not been publicly named, into custody Tuesday. As of Wednesday morning, formal charges had not been filed, but police said they expected to file charges within 36 hours. Meanwhile, investigators are reviewing video, social media, and evidence gathered from the autopsy, the Tribune reported .ALSO WATCH:Bauer is the first Chicago police officer to be shot and killed in the line of duty since 2011. He became commander of CPDs Near North District in 2016, following stints as the commander of the departments mounted patrol unit and as a tactical lieutenant on the citys near West Side.Bauer had recently criticized Chicagos justice system for what he saw as excessive lenience in prosecuting and jailing career criminals.Were not talking about the guy that stole a loaf of bread from the store to feed his family, Bauer told the Loop North News last year, according to the Tribune. Were talking about career robbers, burglars, drug dealers. These are all crimes against the community. They need to be off the street.The suspect in Bauers killing is a fourtime convicted felon, police said.Follow Will on TwitterSend tips to email protected .Freedom of Speech Isnt FreeThe Daily Caller News Foundation is working hard to balance out the biased American media.

319 WGN-AM named new radio home of the White Sox - Chicago Tribune Baseball is coming back to WGNAM 720 , named the new radio flagship of the White Sox on Wednesday.Get ready, kids, the sweet sounds of the ballyard return to 720 on Friday, February 23rd, live from Arizona, Todd Manley, WGN AMs station manager and vice president of content, wrote in a memo to staff.Ed Farmer is returning for his 13th season as a Sox announcer, teamed for a 10th season with Darrin Jackson.Under the multiyear contract, WGNAM will carry a weekly yearround program showcasing the team in addition to all regularseason and postseason Sox games, a pregame and postgame show and a selection of spring training exhibitions.Financial terms were not disclosed.Its a fantastic win for White Sox fans, Brooks Boyer, Sox senior vice president of sales and marketing, said in a statement. We are thrilled to team up with an iconic media organization in Chicago, delivering the hustle and passion of White Sox games to WGN radio listeners throughout the city and Midwest.The Sox had been poised to enter the third season of a sixyear contract with WLSAM 890, but a U.S. bankruptcy judge put the Sox rights up for grabs this month at the request of the stations parent company, Cumulus Media.Cumulus asked to nullify what it said were 20 or so extremely unprofitable contracts, including those with the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Bulls .That led the Bulls, who were in the second season of a fiveyear deal with WLSAM, to jump to Entercom Communications WSCRAM 670 in the middle of a West Coast trip this month.The Sox now shift to Tribune Media s WGNAM, which ended a 56year run as radio home of the Cubs in 2014. Tribune Media spun off its newspapers, including the Chicago Tribune, that same year.WSCRAM, now the radio home of the Cubs, broadcast the Sox for 10 seasons before their jump to WLSAM after the 2015 campaign.WGNAM already has the Blackhawks and Northwestern football and basketball. Tribune Media corporate sibling WGN9 is the Soxs broadcast TV home, complementing games on cables NBC Sports Chicago.The Sox regularly aired games on WGNAM between 1927 and 1943, with announcers such as Jack Brickhouse, Bob Elson and Quin Ryan behind the microphone. But that arrangement predated the team assigning exclusive rights, and its games aired on multiple Chicago stations.This deal comes as Marylandbased Sinclair Broadcast Group is seeking government approval to finalize its acquisition of Tribune Media, which Sinclair first announced in May.Bulls move to WSCRAM 670 WLSAM parent company asks court to end unprofitable White Sox, Bulls deals Paul Sullivan: White Sox deserve a better radio partner Reliever Joakim Soria arrives at White Sox camp to do what I do White Soxs first bullpen sessions of spring training Expitcher Esteban Loaiza to face charges of cocaine dealing Privacy Policy Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Chicago White Sox WGN Chicago Bulls Tribune Media Chicago Cubs Spring Training WGN Radio

2 Chicago Music Exchange Memphis coming to an end:( - Page 3 Chicago Music Exchange Memphis coming to an end Its really disappointing to me how these posts drift off topicand involve politics and  after the fact opinions on the CME blowout sale.CME clearly disclosed these guitars as  floor models  with some issues and were priced accordingly . So you either participated or you didnt period They also have a risk free refund policy that they honored admirably. They certainly cannot be expected to anticipate the subjectivity of every buyer  as it relates to a floor model with some issues.Some of these issues were slight , some more obvious the later of which should have been caught during pre delivery inspection and I agree with the overall sentiment regarding those obvious unplayable issues.Nonetheless  many of us , including myself had to return a guitar for various reasons , but in the end my inconvenience , and participation in this sale was rewarded by the receipt of a gorgeous figured light burst 335 , that plays like butter and screams 60s Gibson tone . Cost 1600  well worth it to me.As for online purchases  get use to it local retail stores cannot carry the inventory, or have 5 or 6 of a particular model for the discriminating buyer to sort through to find the perfect guitar.No complaints here  thank you CME and Gibson for this opportunity.

Paul Bauer, left, takes part in the arrest of a protester outside an Apple store on Magnificent Mile in Chicago. Promoted to commander, Bauer, 53, a 31year veteran...   By DON BABWINAssociated Press CHICAGO AP  A police commander who was killed after a foot chase in downtown Chicago was shot in the head by a suspect carrying a semiautomatic handgun equipped with an extended clip of ammunition, a police official told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The official, who was briefed on the investigation, spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to provide such details until charges are filed against the suspect in the death of Cmdr. Paul Bauer. Bauer, who had been on the police force for 31 years, was shot Tuesday afternoon after spotting a man matching the radio description of an armed suspect, Chicago police have said. The official told the AP that Bauer, 53, had identified himself as a police officer and was trying to trying to detain the suspect when they got into a physical fight and fell down a stairwell that led to a locked underground walkway. Police spokesman Frank Giancamilli would not comment on the weapon but said the suspect was wearing a bulletproof vest under a heavy coat when he was arrested. The Chicago Police Department has said tactical officers had detained the suspect outside the James R. Thompson Center government building when the man fled. Officers initially confronted the suspect because he was acting suspiciously, according to police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. Some initial media reports said the suspect may have been involved in the robbery of a local business, but Johnson did not provide details about what the man was doing that prompted officers to want to speak with him. Officers had been chasing the man on foot when Bauer saw the offender and engaged in an armed physical confrontation, Johnson said Tuesday afternoon. Police captured the suspect a short time later, and a gun was recovered at the scene, he said. I just ask the citizens of this city to keep the Bauer family in their prayers, said Johnson, who choked back tears as he spoke to reporters outside the hospital where Bauer had been pronounced dead. It was initially reported that Bauer was off duty, but police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter late Tuesday that Bauer was on duty. He said in an email Wednesday that it was a chaotic scene and Bauer had been attending training at the Chicago Fire Department with other officials before the shooting. There was no communication from him on the radio informing dispatch that he was in pursuit of the offender or that he was even on scene, so they initially thought it was an offduty officer until someone recognized him, Guglielmi wrote. Mayor Rahm Emanuel called Bauers death a tragic reminder of the dangerous duty the men and women of our police department accept to ensure the safety of us all. Noreen Danko was on her way to her office nearby when she heard the gunshots. I was walking down the street and I heard pop pop pop pop pop, Danko told the Chicago Tribune. And I said to the girl next to me, Is that what I think it is And she said, Yep. I said, Aw geez. And everybody is scurrying all over and I see the police head to the stairs there. She said she saw officers lead the shackled suspect away and put him in a squad car, then watched as emergency workers administered CPR to Bauer, who was lying on a stretcher, before he was put inside an ambulance and rushed to the hospital. ___ This story has been corrected to indicate that the commander was on duty, not off duty, based on updated information from police.

11 ADMBunge deal would create Cargill-sized agribusiness giant - Chicago Tribune The world of agriculturalcommodity trading could be upended with the merger of two of its biggest names. ArcherDanielsMidland Co. has sought deal talks with Bunge Ltd., a person briefed on the matter said at the weekend. Thats less than a year after Glencore approached Bunge about a deal. What ADMBunge would look like: While theyre not exactly household names, ADM and Bunge have been around for 116 years and 200 years respectively and are among the very largest buyers and sellers of grains and other crops.But both companies do a lot more than that: they crush soybeans, produce vegetable oil and supply biofuels  ADM even has a unit that manufacturers flavors. So, on paper at least, a combined ADMBunge would be both a commoditytrading giant, with an international network of barges and marine terminals, and a major industrial enterprise with factories and refineries.Where they really differ is geographic footprint. Bunge has a much larger presence in South America, while ADM is bigger in the U.S. Combining the two would create a company that, at least in terms of revenue, would be approaching the size of Cargill Inc., the largest agricultural company.Why now First, times are tough for crop traders. A glut isnt only depressing prices but also sapping volatility, which is bad news for grain merchants like ADM and Bunge, as well as Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Corp., the four storied trading houses known in the industry as the ABCDs.Bunge is the smallest of the four traders and theyve struggled to turn around the ship, Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.ADM last year cut jobs and reshuffled management, while White Plains, New Yorkbased Bunge slashed its profit guidance several times and unveiled a plan to eliminate 250 million in costs. A merger is an obvious way to accelerate and deepen such savings. Soren Schroder, Bunges chief executive officer, acknowledged last year that industry consolidation may be needed amid such challenging conditions.Ryan Ori Archer Daniels Midland doesnt plan to shutter a wheat mill in the Fulton Market district until 2019. But with real estate values soaring in the area, the agribusiness giant isnt waiting to cash in with a sale of the 2.2acre property.Chicagobased ADM and Larry Goldwasser, one of the Cushman...Archer Daniels Midland doesnt plan to shutter a wheat mill in the Fulton Market district until 2019. But with real estate values soaring in the area, the agribusiness giant isnt waiting to cash in with a sale of the 2.2acre property.Chicagobased ADM and Larry Goldwasser, one of the Cushman...Ryan Ori Second, ADM is likely to be acting on the knowledge that Glencore could come back again after its initial approach. Whats next ADM or Bunge have declined to comment on their potential merger. All eyes are also on Glencore, which up till now has been prevented from making a renewed approach to Bunge because of a standstill agreement.Could this turn into an auction for Bunge For a company that is known for its aggressive and prolific dealmaking, Glencore is notable for almost never making a hostile takeover offer. Its worth remembering, too, that Glencore saw off interest from ADM to acquire Canadian grain handler Viterra Inc. in 2012.What price a deal Bunge shares jumped 11 percent on Jan. 19 after ADMs interest was first reported, giving it a market value of 10.9 billion for comparison, Chicagobased ADMs market capitalization is 22.9 billion. They were up 3.1 percent at 79.99 at 11:11 a.m. in New York.While Bunges stock has yet to revisit the highs seen last year, there may be limited upside. Glencore bought Viterra for 10.1 times the Canadian companys Ebitda, while Bunge is currently valued at 13.1 times earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bunge could fetch anywhere from 90 to 100 a share, analysts from Citigroup, Credit Suisse Group and the Vertical Group said in reports Monday. Antitrust challenges: If an ADMBunge tieup were to happen, regulators are likely to take a close look at the combined companys market share, especially in its domestic market.There could be criticism from farmers, just like there has been with another agricultural megamerger, Bayers acquisition of Monsanto. Department of Justice lawyers have sought out farmers who are opposed to that deal.Bloombergs Javier Blas contributed.Inside Amazon Go: The camerafilled convenience store that watches you back Bank of America ends free checking option, causing customer uproar Winnetka trader pleads guilty in commodities scheme that lost 13.8 million Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Glencore International AG

13 Pritzker’s African-American problem, and a whole lotta &amp;apos;glove&amp;apos; - Chicago Tribune Just how much will J.B. Pritzkers footinmouth problem with AfricanAmerican politicians cost himUnderstand this: It will cost him, and though hes relatively new to politics, he is a billionaire, so hell have to pay mightily for his Chicago political education.He made disparaging, patronizing comments about AfricanAmerican politicians on an FBI tape and now hes being beaten up for it.One of the more entertaining beatings has Pritzker mocked as oneeyed Jack by prominent South Side Democrat Emil Jones , which is a line from a great Marlon Brando movie.So dont tell me Pritzker wont pay, because he will, if he wants to stop the beating. And please dont tell me that Pritzkers ally, Mayor Rahm Emanuel , isnt trying to avoid this issue, hoping that reporters dont ask him about it.The mayor would rather talk about anything else  scholarships to City Colleges for public high school students, even his wife Amys horridtasting healthy shakes, which contain beets.But Emanuel doesnt want to talk about what Pritzker said about black politicians.Chicagos first black mayor, the late Mayor Harold Washington, loved to say that politics aint beanbag. In keeping with Washingtons realistic views on politics, here are three facts about Pritzkers dilemma you should know:1 Beanbags arent free.2 Without black voters, there is no Democratic Party in Illinois, and no chance for Pritzker to win the nomination for governor.3 Pritzkers Democratic primary opponent, Chris Kennedy, is using the controversy to make a hard play for AfricanAmerican votes. If hes successful, then Emanuels 2019 reelection chances may be in serious peril.If you think politics is about something other than who gets what, and how much, then you might just want to pick up a mandolin, sing a song and take another hit off the Hopium pipe.Robert Starks doesnt smoke Hopium. A longtime community organizer and professor of political science, Starks was with Harold Washington from the beginning.Hes listed as a solid Kennedy supporter in news reports, but Starks says that hes only leaning Kennedys way.J.B. Pritzker apologizes Feb. 6, 2018, about comments he made on a taped phone conversation with thenGov. Rod Blagojevich. John Byrne  Chicago TribuneJ.B. Pritzker apologizes Feb. 6, 2018, about comments he made on a taped phone conversation with thenGov. Rod Blagojevich. John Byrne  Chicago TribuneSEE MORE VIDEOS This controversy has given Kennedy an opening, said Starks. Now well see if Kennedy really steps up on the political and policy fronts. If Kennedy wins the primary, hell do so with AfricanAmerican votes, and that will be seen as an open threat to Mayor Emanuel, who is hoping things stay pretty much the way they are.So, with this much at stake, Pritzker will pay. All were talking about now is the price. And the price has gone up.It skyrocketed a few days ago when the Tribune broke the news that Pritzker was on that FBI tape with nowimprisoned Gov. Rod Blagojevich, talking disparagingly about black politicians filling the U.S. Senate vacancy created when Barack Obama was elected president.Pritzker put both feet up in there, chomped on them and swallowed hard in that Nov. 14, 2008, talk with the crooked governor, which was first reported by the Tribune earlier this week. A taped conversation between Pritzker and Blago revealed by the Tribune in June became the basis of an ad campaign by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner.Pritzker told Blago that appointing Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White to fill the Obama vacancy would cover you on the AfricanAmerican thing.Pritzker dismissed Emil Jones  Obamas political godfather  as too crass. He said Jesse Jackson Jr. was a nightmare and joined Blago in mocking Obamas former pastor, the incendiary Rev. Jeremiah Wright .Was this racism or politics I dont think it was overt racism. I think it was Democratic politics  two white Democrats discussing AfricanAmerican pawns on their game board.But then, Im not running for governor.Jones is a master politician and Kennedy supporter. He turned on this like a cat on a fat rabbit.He mocked Pritzker, saying he curried favor with Blago by offering up safe black candidates for the Senate.Hes a oneeyed Jack, said Jones. He runs around and says one thing, but the wiretap shows you a different person. It shows you the other side of his face and the other side of his face is what he is.In the superb 1961 Western OneEyed Jacks, Brando who also directed faces his betrayer, the villain Dad Longworth, played by Karl Malden:Youre a oneeyed Jack around this town, Dad, but Ive just seen the other side of your face.Boom.Pritzker found AfricanAmerican politicians whove endorsed him. He stood next to them for comfort and said he was sorry. They didnt look happy about standing there. They looked pained, as if theyd just undergone an awkward medical procedure.On Wednesday, he had Cook County Board President Toni Taxwinkle endorse him.Pritzker hasnt wept publicly yet, but if he needs to, he will.In the meantime, his surrogates will use rhetoric and euphemism to explain his moves. Theyll say hes reaching out to the black community, that hes seeking to connect with the community and make amends for his sins.What it all means is that Pritzker cannot take the AfricanAmerican vote for granted. And hell have to make arrangements with black political leaders on funding their campaigns and supporting their causes.This is how politics works.J.B.s running around town, calling people, apologizing, and people are saying he needs to show the community some love, a prominent AfricanAmerican politician told me Wednesday.But love isnt enough. J.Bs got to show us some glove, the politico said.Glove I asked. Glove, gloveYeah, glove, he laughed. Thats love with a g on it. You understandYes, I do.And you spell glove this way: .Listen to The Chicago Way podcast with John Kass and Jeff Carlin at http:wgnradio.comcategorywgnplusthechicagoway .jskass@chicagotribune.comTwitter @John_KassRELATED: Preckwinkle backs Pritzker, day after he apologized for remarks on AfricanAmerican politicians Pritzker apologizes for remarks on AfricanAmerican politicians, as rivals say hes now unelectable New PritzkerBlagojevich audio from FBI wiretaps sheds light on race issue in governor contest Letter: Why J.B.

14 Man arrested after breaching security at Illinois airport Man arrested after breaching security at Illinois airport 21818 11:17 AM PEORIA, Ill.  Several weekend flights were delayed or canceled at an Illinois airport after a man tried to use a stolen vehicle to ram the main terminal and breached security. The Gen. Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport in central Illinois says in a news release that the man was taken into custody and to a hospital after the incident early Saturday. The airport was closed for a few hours. Airport officials say the man used the car to try to ram the building but was unsuccessful. He then forced his way inside and spent several minutes in a secured area before trying to break into a police vehicle. The mans condition wasnt immediately clear, nor whether he had been charged. The Associated Press couldnt reach Peoria County sheriffs officials Sunday. Authorities believe the incident was isolated. TAGS

19 Police believe Canadian billionaire, wife were murdered, decline to discuss suspects - Chicago Tribune Police said Friday they believe Canadian drugcompany billionaire businessman Barry Sherman and his wife were both murdered.Det. Sgt. Susan Gomes said investigators came to the conclusion after six weeks of investigation, but said there are no suspects.The founder of generic drugmaker Apotex and his wife, Honey, were found dead in their mansion on Dec. 15. Police said then the deaths were suspicious, but said there were no signs of forced entry and they were not looking for suspects.Gomes said the two were found hanging by belts from a railing that surrounds their indoor pool and were in a semiseated position on the pool deck.We have sufficient evidence to describe this as a double homicide investigation and that both Honey and Barry Sherman were in fact targeted, Gomes said.She said they were last seen alive in the evening hours of Wednesday Dec. 13 and were not heard from again until their bodies were found late Friday morning.Gomes said there are no signs of forced entry at access points of the home. She declined to discuss the evidence, possible motives or suspects.We havent developed any suspects, Gomes said.Rob Gillies  AP This Jan. 6, 2018, photo shows police crime scene tape marking off the property belonging to Barry and Honey Sherman, who were found strangled inside their home on Dec. 15, 2017.This Jan. 6, 2018, photo shows police crime scene tape marking off the property belonging to Barry and Honey Sherman, who were found strangled inside their home on Dec. 15, 2017.Rob Gillies  AP The day after the bodies were found, some prominent news media outlets Quote: d unidentified police officials as saying the deaths appeared to be a murdersuicide. That upset the couples four adult children, who then hired their own team of investigators and a pathologist, who conducted second autopsies on the Shermans.The family said in a statement Friday that the new conclusion was expressed by the family from the outset and is consistent with the findings of the independent autopsy and investigation.The family continues to support the Toronto Police Service in their efforts to seek justice for their parents and pursue those responsible for these unspeakable crimes, the statement addedPolice have released the home back to the family.

24 Michelle Obama Presents 2018 Counselor of the Year Award to Chicago Educator - High School &amp; Beyond - Education Week Michelle Obama Presents 2018 Counselor of the Year Award to Chicago Educator By Rachel Wegner on February 5, 2018 1:29 PM  No comments Kirsten Perry has heard her share of painful stories of loss, hardship, and misfortune as a public school counselor on the west side of Chicago. But she is even more deeply moved by the resilience of her students and the families and vibrance of the community around them. On Friday, Perry received the national 2018 School Counselor of the Year award during a celebration at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. The American School Counselor Association ASCA also honored one school counselor from each state, along with Perry. The awardees gathered on stage as former first lady Michelle Obama presented the national award, giving her first televised speech since her time in the White House. We know where the real work of changing kids lives happens, Obama said. It happens on the ground, in classrooms, and communities, and in those facetoface, hearttoheart interactions between our kids and caring educators and counselors, like the folks on this stage. Days later, Perry said she was still in shock at meeting the former first lady. Im still processing the whole thing, she said with a laugh. Like, did that really happen Obama revisited her promise to continue the work she started with the Reach Higher Initiative, which encourages students to pursue education beyond high school. She was joined by several celebrities and leaders at the celebration, including ASCA Executive Director Richard Wong, reality cooking show host Ted Allen, Reach Higher Executive Director Eric Waldo and former U.S. Secretary of Education John B. King. Reflecting on anxious times for the nation, Obama encouraged those gathered to remain hopeful. You all have the power to teach our kids what it means to go high when others go low, Obama said. She introduced Perry as a perfect example of that work. After Perry began working at Lawndale Community Academy in 2015, the PreK8 school rose to level two academic standing among Chicagos public schools. The school was at level three, the lowest in the district, for the five years preceding that. Lawndale has also seen a 61 percent drop in chronic absenteeism since Perry began. She has launched numerous initiatives and programs, including everything from a running club to gathering students in peace circles. Peace circles are a place where students in conflict gather, discuss their issues, and work together toward a peaceful solution. Perry said it is part of a restorative justice approach to addressing student beavhior she is working to implement. She explained in an interview that past approaches have been more punitive, punishing behaviors with suspensions and other disciplinary actions. Restorative justice is more about building community, getting to the root cause of a students behavior, and working through the lens of providing support, Perry said. She said that Lawndale still has much to learn when it comes to restorative justice, but that the school is seeing some success as staff members work toward the new system. At times, Perry said teachers and parents are involved in the peace circles or resolution efforts. Two students also spoke at the event about the personal impact Perry made on their lives. Student Kyla Evans said Perry helped her control her anger and encouraged her to stop skipping school. And even though Evans is now enrolled as a 9th grader at another school, she still comes to visit Perry. I know she will keep pushing me to go to school, believe in myself, and think about my future, Evans said. Miss Perry shows every day that she cares about all the kids at Lawndale. Perry said crime, poverty, and the lingering effects of systemic racism facing Lawndale create challenges from day to day. But she also said she finds joy in watching her students transform and witnessing a strong, vibrant community fight for a better future. Ive only been working in Lawndale twoandahalf years, Perry said. I feel like Im getting too much credit compared to some people who are so deepy invested in the community. Theyve been working and fighting this battle for decades. In her acceptance speech, Perry said school counselors are advocates, collaborators, and systemic change agents who can be a voice for the the voiceless. She hopes her students also find their own voices along the way.

25 IU basketball flunks road test at Illinois CHAMPAIGN, Ill.  An ugly second half doomed to an avoidable defeat Wednesday night at Illinois, the Hoosiers falling 7371. Coach Archie Millers team struggled to deal with the highpressure defense the Illini applied, and to hit free throws consistently. Those mistakes handed Illinois its first Big Ten win, and brought IU 129, 54 back to earth after .had 28 points and eight rebounds, and Zach McRoberts had 10 points, all in the first half.Here are Three Reasons Why the Hoosiers couldnt take their success on the road:Costly free throws Indiana was hardly the countrys best freethrow shooting outfit entering Wednesday. The Hoosiers season mark of 66.7 percent before their trip to Illinois was a bottom50 number nationally.Yet somehow it managed to sink further, cheap points being tossed away for an offense that can hardly afford to waste them.IU started an abysmal 4of12 from the freethrow line, a number that played a key role in Illinois hanging around. The Hoosiers finished just 16of29 from the line, a damaging number on the road.Foul disparity If freethrow shooting was a known problem coming in, foul issues were not a problem.In Big Ten play alone, the Hoosiers were fourth in the league in opponent freethrow rate. They typically do well keeping opponents away from the line.Illinois 1111, 18 proved an exception to the rule, especially in the second half. The Illini got into the bonus with more than 13 minutes remaining, and wound up with 30 freethrow attempts in the second half.The Hoosiers own problems getting free throws to go down were only made more glaring by Illinois performance. The hosts shot 23of32 on free throws Wednesday evening.Missed free throws kept IU from building a more comfortable and probably deserved lead at halftime. Giving Illinois too many doomed the Hoosiers after the break.Senioritis Senior guards and Josh Newkirk have been part of the solution during IUs strong start to Big Ten play. They were part of the problem Wednesday night.Together, the pair combined for 10 points, three assists and seven turnovers, as subdued of a performance as theyve had together in some time.Newkirk struggled to perform against Illinois pressure. Miller opted to give Devonte Green a share of his minutes.Johnson couldnt seem to find a rhythm on the offensive end, turning in perhaps his quietest game since going scoreless at Louisville on Dec. 9. He hit a couple of timely 3pointers in the first half but managed only a marginal impact in the second, often struggling to get the ball in his hands and beat Illinois perimeter defense.Miller is fond of saying his team is always best when his backcourt is working well. Its leaders couldnt keep the pace Wednesday night.Follow IndyStar reporter Zach Osterman on Twitter: @ZachOsterman.CLOSE The Indiana Hoosiers gritty win over Maryland suggests improvement, especially in response to Michigan State.

29 Illinois Bill Aims To End Youth Tackle Football http:ift.tt2nbLdny A new plan in Illinois aims to end youth tackle football programs with the goal of preventing Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy CTE, a degenerative disease of the brain caused by repetitive brain trauma. The bill bears the name of Dave Duerson, a 1985 Chicago Bear who killed himself. Doing so by shooting himself in the chest in order to preserve his brain for research. Tregg Duerson, Daves son, says he hopes sharing his fathers story will give the bill necessary momentum. When I look at my fathers action of donating his brain in the very last moments of his life, that was someone who was trying to be helpful and trying to be part of the solution to the greater problem of concussions and brain trauma.Research proved Duerson did suffer from CTE. Something Tregg says he recognizes now in hindsight.He showed that he was forgetful and confused and disoriented. I can also point to times when he was just overwhelmed with anger and depression, says Tregg. When I think about my father and all he experienced, I really look at the suicide note that he left me and my family. In that note he described his troubles with memory, blurred vision, writing and spelling, as well as the pain he felt in his head. State Representative Carol Sente, a Democrat from Vernon Hills is sponsoring the bill. In a press release , Sente says research and data prove the risks of playing tackle football arent worth it. I am confident we have the science on our side and can make a very persuasive argument that safer football for youth will lead to healthier and more rewarding lives for generations to come.Illinois has made improvements in concussion protocols, including a 2015 law requiring athletic programs to develop concussion response procedures. Although some suggest smaller schools or programs with limited resources may be at a disadvantage. A recent study found CTE in 110 out of 111 deceased NFL players whose brains were analyzed.If approved Illinois would be the first state to ban youth tackle football. 09ILSN,15Health,19Legal,30Bapo,E Sente,RK ClientFeedsvia Podcast  NPR Illinois  91.9 UIS http:nprillinois.org January 25, 2018 at 04:20PM

38 Chicago anti-gang cops may have robbed drug dealers: report close Video Chicago gang members say more police wont cure citys ills Mike Tobin reportsMultiple members of a Chicago Police Department antigang unit have been stripped of their authority following a federal probe into allegations that they robbed drug dealers.The decision to suspend the police powers of a sergeant and several officers  who were on the departments Area Central antigang team  came after nearly a yearlong probe by the FBI and Chicago police Internal Affairs Division, the Chicago Tribune reported.Authorities raided at least two of the officers homes Tuesday. Although no arrests were made, criminal charges were expected to be filed.The investigation started after an informant told federal authorities that he had been robbed by members of police antigang unit. Authorities reportedly set up a sting operation to catch the officers on undercover video.The unnamed 45yearold sergeant has been working in the department since 1996 and has seen 23 complaints filed against him during his 21 years on the force, including alleged illegal arrests, civil rights violations and improper use of a weapon, the Tribune reported.The sergeant has also been named in four federal lawsuits since 2001, including a still open case regarding a fatal 2014 police shooting of an allegedly suicidal man who attacked the officers with a knife.The latest scandal is another setback to the Chicago Police Department still reeling from the shooting of 17yearold Laquan McDonald and other scandals such as officers allegedly stealing cash and drugs from drug dealers. The Obama Justice Department indicted the department in January 2016 and accused the police officers of being poorly trained, undisciplined, and inadequately supervised.In a bid to avoid federal government intrusion, however, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel worked with U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions Justice Department to come up with an agreement that avoids federal oversight on police reforms.A spokesman for the police said integrity and accountability are paramount to the force but did not comment on the probe until or unless criminal charges are filed.Lukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

40 NISSAN 370Zki BRINGS NEW MEANING TO ‘WINTER SPORTS’ AT THE 2018 CHICAGO AUTO SHOW Nissan is getting into the winter sports spirit this month with a specially constructed, oneoff 370Z Roadster snowmobile. Dubbed the 370Zki  pronounced 370Ski  the 332horsepower 370Z Roadster is ready to tackle ski slopes and backwoods trails alike with its front skis and rear snow tracks replacing the iconic sports cars usual high performance tires. The Nissan 370Zki makes its world debut this week at the 2018 Chicago Auto Show. Nissan 370Zki The Nissan 370Zki continues our recent tradition of bringing imaginative winter vehicle concepts to the Chicago Auto Show. With the Nissan Zs long heritage of motorsports competition, the 370Zki seemed like a natural combination, said Michael Bunce, vice president, Product Planning, Nissan North America, Inc. Prior to its debut here in Chicago, we put the 370Zki through its paces on the slopes in Wyoming where its performance heritage really came through.Transforming the factory stock 370Z Roadster to the snow trackcarving 370Zki presented a few understandable obstacles. To make room for the rear DOMINATOR  Tracks from American Track Truck, Inc ., the entire drivetrain was first removed from the 370Z Roadster. Then a custom lift kit was designed and engineered, lifting the vehicle three inches from the normal height. Next came fabrication of custom mountings for the rear suspension springs and threeinch custom spacers to mount the snow tracks to the wheel hubs. The factory brakes were retained but the brake lines had to be rerouted and the exhaust system was modified to fit under the vehicle. The rear wheel wells were also modified for clearance of the fourfootlong snow tracks.In front, the suspension was modified to accommodate the new ride height, and adaptors were made to allow the appropriate travel and rotation for the front skis  which were also supplied by American Track Truck, Inc.  and mounted with spacers to the stock wheel hubs. The engine and transmission also had to be custommounted and a front skid plate fabricated to prevent damage during snow excursions.By comparison, the cosmetic part of the conversion was relatively easy. The custom body wrap was created and applied by Icon Image Graphics and the headlights were tinted yellow to resemble ski goggles.Nissans full range of winter adventureready vehicles will be on display throughout the Chicago Auto Show, from our bestselling Rogue AWD to the powerful TITAN 4x4 and TITAN XD 4x4 lineups, said Bunce. Its also fun to shake things up with something totally unexpected once in a while  and thats the Nissan 370Zki.Nissan 370Zki Project Build Specifications Base Vehicle:              Nissan 370Z RoadsterDrivetrain:                    332horsepower 3.7liter DOHC V6, 7speed automatic transmission, rearwheel driveTop:                                   Cloth powerfolding roof with fabric inner linerModifications: Partsystem Suppliermodification DOMINATOR  TracksAmerican Track Truck, Inc.Width 15 inchesLength 48 inchesHeight 30 inchesFront skisAmerican Track Truck, Inc.Width 12 inchesLength 56 inchesWheel wellsOpened up front and rearWheel spacers3inch front and rearSuspensionCustom mounting fabrication frontand rearBrakesFactory spec front and rear,relocated  including brake linesSteeringFactory specEngineFactory spec 3.7liter V6, 332 hp,270 lbft torqueBody wrapIcon Image GraphicsThe Nissan 370Zki will be on public display at the 2018 Chicago Auto Show, which runs Feb. 1019 at Chicagos McCormick Place.

43 Simple Tips For Body Piercing In Chicago IL By Pamela Snyder The decision to get a piercing should never be taken lightly, because the risk of infection, scarring and major corrective surgery is extremely high. Research, comparisons and reviews can help you find the best quality services, but preparation to help your new physical modification along, will protect against the loss of your stud, earring or enhancement. Tips for body piercing in Chicago IL can protect your health and provide lasting aesthetics.Every area of the body may be pierced whether a traditional earring to eyebrow rings, nose studs and genitalia. The procedure is not as simple as picking the first artist you come across and hoping for the best, but to invest in research and to speak to professionals to ensure they are familiar with what you are looking for. When things do not work out the way as planned, you could be facing the expenses of hospital bills for infections and will lose the piercings.Unfortunately not all body pierce artists offer an equal standard of service and without investigation into practices you may pay the price. Professionals must have experience, skill and knowledge of the procedure to minimize excessive bleeding, scarring and an inability to keep the area pierced. Regardless of personal reasons for piercings, a high standard of hygiene practices and care must be taken to protect your wellbeing.Any medical problems must be discussed with a practitioner before getting the body modification performed. Factors including hypertension and diabetes should be expressed to minimize illness during the procedure and to alert the professional of steps they must take to monitor your health during the placement. There is greater risk of infections for those who possess a compromised immune system.Practicality is an important part of choosing piercings to ensure you can maintain it, will be satisfied with it long term and it does not interfere with personal and professional activities. Constantly fidgeting over an item of jewelry can cause an infection to form and prevents the area from healing. Assess your professional needs and whether a visible addition may compromise work related opportunities.An experienced practitioner must provide detailed maintenance practices to best manage your healthcare and enhancement needs. Many types of modifications are available and requires a clear assessment of each before proceeding with a final selection. Experienced artists will deliver complete instructions on the maintenance of these pieces and deliver the most beneficial solutions for your healthcare and aesthetic needs.Research into the practices and procedures of a select artist is an imperative part of the process. Look at previous work completed, assess customer reviews and consult with the artist to listen to their practices and suggestions. The facility where the piercing is to be performed must be clean, well organized and incorporate personal interests into the design.High quality procedures and steps will provide the most effective solutions for your needs and minimize the risk associated with poor practice. Significant enhancement practices delivered by professional and experienced artists can help you achieve appealing results and prevent complications.

46 Chicago condo owners: New law erodes privacy - Residential News - Crain&#39;s Chicago Business Photo by Getty ImagesiStockphoto Condo owners: New law erodes privacy Two Chicago aldermen want to give condo boards in the city the power to ignore a piece of Illinois condo law that some homeowners consider a threat to their privacy. The state rule, which went into effect Jan. 1, requires a condo association to provide a list of contact informationincluding mailing address, phone number and email addresson all unit owners to any owner who requests it. The rule is intended to provide transparency, said state Rep. Andre Thapedi, the chief sponsor of HB 189. His district runs from Park Manor on the citys South Side west to suburban Hickory Hills. Owners should be able to communicate with each other, Thapedi said in an email to Crains. The bill, he said, puts the same information into the hands of unit owners that the condo board and the management company, if there is one, already have access to. Does it make sense that joint owners should only be able to communicate with each other through management companies and lawyers Thapedi asked. Last spring, Thapedis HB 189 passed both houses of the General Assembly with nearunanimous votes. Gov. Bruce Rauner signed it into law in August. After it went into effect at the dawn of 2018, I got hundreds of calls, letters and emails from condo owners who object to that information being given out, said Ald. Brian Hopkins, 2nd, who along with Ald. Brendan Reilly, 42nd, proposed a city ordinance Jan. 17 that essentially makes the rule optional. Reilly and Hopkins represent wards that are among the densest with condos. Their ordinance would prohibit the release of unit owners contact information unless at least twothirds of unit owners have voted to adopt the state rule. That is, condo boards in the city would be exempt from the state rule unless they opt in. Hopkins said numerous residents told him the state rule is intrusive. People dont want their personal contact information given out. Reilly said in an emailed statement that he expects the ordinance to be discussed at the February meeting of the City Councils Committee on Housing  Real Estate. Reilly said that decisions regarding unit owners privacy should be handled with the most local of local controls: a majority vote of the full homeowners association. This will allow each condominium building to have important conversations about balancing privacy with transparency. The state rule is pretty universally disliked by our homeowners, said Judy Ziner, vice president for operations in the Chicago office of Liberman Management Services, which manages 12,000 condo units in the city and a total of 45,000 in the Chicago area. A lot of people use only a cellphone because they dont want uninvited phone calls, Ziner said. And they dont want a lot of email cluttering their inbox. Surface mail, she said, should be sufficient for communicating associationrelated matters, and many large condos have online bulletin boards or forums where owners can communicate about issues facing the condo board. Since the new rule went into effect, some condo owners have withdrawn their email and phone information from the management companies files, Ziner said. That could prove problematic in the event of an emergency when the management company needs to reach unit owners quickly. Theres value in sharing limited contact information among owners, Reillys statement said, but the new state law simply goes too far. Thapedi said that sharing owners contact information is a step toward more open communication among owners. When a condo board is entertaining offers from developers for a bulk buy of all the units in the building for deconversion to rentals, for example, keep in mind, were talking about a group of people who own something together, Thapedi said, but theyre prevented from communicating their desires to their fellow owners. While most condo owners, and particularly those who dont live in the building full time, want the management company to have their phone and email information in case of an emergency, Hopkins said, they dont want that information given out to everyone who aspires to run for a seat on the condo board, or who has a grievance about something the board did. The politics in a condo building, Hopkins said, can get intense, and some people dont want to be contacted about it. The rule includes a requirement that a unit owner promise not to use the list for commercial purposes, but its too vague, both Ziner and Hopkins said. People who request the list should be required to state their precise intention with the information, Hopkins said. The aldermens proposed ordinance invokes home rule, the power of a municipality to go its own way on a matter that the state legislates. Hopkins said this was necessary because the state rule snuck in under the radar. It was not something people were aware of until after the law passed, so were responding retroactively. Thapedi countered that its unfortunate that certain aldermen want to abrogate the letter and spirit of state regulation of condominium ownership.

Mays elementary school in the Englewood neighborhood Chicago. Five years after the nations largest mas... By SOPHIA TAREEN and DON BABWINAssociated Press CHICAGO AP  Five years after the largest mass closure of public schools in an American city, Chicago is forging ahead with a plan to shutter four more in one of the citys highestcrime and most impoverished areas. School officials are pitching the new closures around Englewood, a neighborhood on Chicagos South Side, to make way for a new 85 million school they insist will better serve students and reverse low enrollment. But some parents, students and activists are skeptical, saying theyre still reeling from the 2013 closures and the latest plan will make things worse, including the displacement of hundreds of mostly black and poor teenagers. The last thing they should do is close our schools, said 16yearold Miracle Boyd, a student at John Hope College Prep, which could close. They arent the ones sitting in those chairs five days a week struggling to learn because we dont have the necessities we need as students. ... Why not use the 85 million to improve our education and get our schools on the road to success Like other cities, Chicago has long relied on closures to address underperforming and underutilized schools. Significant closures have taken place in Philadelphia, Detroit and St. Louis, but Chicago made history when it closed roughly 50 schools, affecting more than 12,000 students in mostly AfricanAmerican and Latino neighborhoods. The debate over Chicagos latest proposed closures has exploded, with shouting matches and emotional pleas during community meetings. Residents have pleaded with the district to invest more in neighborhood schools and safety. Some have alleged that racial politics are at play. And they worry by pulling students out of schools near their homes and placing them in ones farther away, they are putting them in danger of gang members who will view them as the enemy just by virtue of their address. Chicago Public Schools says nothing is final until an expected Feb. 28 board vote. The nations thirdlargest school district argues its tried to boost enrollment and resources to the four schools, but it hasnt helped. The changes coincide with a major drop in black residents. Roughly 180,000 people moved from Chicago from 2000 to 2010, according to census data. In Englewood, about 10 miles from downtown, fewer than 500 students are enrolled in the four schools. As a result, one freshmen class has only 17 students and another school doesnt offer science. We have to move these kids. They dont have enough support in these buildings, schools chief Janice Jackson said. We cant sit by and continue to watch people leave. The new school, which would open in 2019, will enroll only freshmen at the beginning, and upperclassmen will be left to attend nearby schools. The district expects to spend millions on the transition, including on individualized plans to help students at risk of dropping out, paid summer job programs and possible shuttle buses to transport students. Research on the benefits of school closures is mixed. In 2017, the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado Boulder compiled research finding that even when students transferred to higherperforming schools, those students saw an achievement drop in the first year and marginal gains later on. Theres no ground to stand on for saying this will improve the educational opportunities, said Pauline Lipman, a University of Illinois at Chicago professor who has studied closures. Chicago Public Schools officials disagree. With past closures, theyve emphasized cost savings. This time, theyve pitched the proposal as a more desirable option for students. Renderings of the new school tout outdoor sports facilities and a community health center. City officials say it complements other recent investment in Englewood, including a new lowercost Whole Foods. But critics, including neighborhood activists and unions, say the district didnt do enough to address problems it helped create and theres a lack of trust, especially after two consecutive CPS leaders left office under scandal. The Chicago Teachers Union blames the citys push for charter schools. Roughly 90 percent of Englewoods students travel beyond neighborhood boundaries for school. Experts say property values will drop, vacant buildings are magnets for street crime and sending students to new schools could put their lives at risk. What people dont understand is that if you are 16 years old and get on a bus, when you get off that bus you are gangaffiliated whether you are gangaffiliated or not, said activist Jitu Brown. Tensions between students from different Chicago neighborhoods attending the same school have erupted in violence before. In 2009, 16yearold honor student Derrion Albert was fatally beaten after getting caught in the middle of such a clash. The attack involving students from Fenger High School on Chicagos South Side was captured on cellphone video that was viewed online worldwide. In Englewood, crime is still high despite a significant drop in homicides and shootings there last year. The violence that remains is startling considering the dwindling population. Demographers say Englewoods population decreased from 59,000 residents in 1980 to 26,000 by 2015. In 2016, there were 86 homicides in Englewood, up from 37 the year before. The Chicago district has had trouble selling and repurposing buildings since 2013 and had to loosen guidelines for potential buyers. There are now about 27 schools on that list, but more than a dozen remain empty, including several in Englewood. Among them is Yale Elementary School, which singing and acting star Jennifer Hudson attended. The eerily quiet brick building sits near boardedup homes and empty lots. Letters on the school sign have fallen off. Under the new proposal, one school would remain vacant, two would be taken over by existing charter schools and one would be demolished for the new school. Not everyone opposes the districts plan. It would be a catalyst for new growth in the area. It gives us something that we can build on, here in Englewood, said Theodria Constanoplis, 74. She has lived in Englewood most of her life, and one of her grandchildren could attend the new school. Still, some educators remain skeptical, saying the closures mark the end of an era. Harper High School theater teacher Michael Buino said his students can compete with those who attend schools considered to be Chicagos best. Michelle Obama, who is from Chicago, visited Harper High in 2013 while still first lady. Come to my classroom and see for yourselves, Buino said at a recent community forum. And then tell me Harper is not worth saving. ___ Follow Sophia Tareen on Twitter at https:twitter.comsophiatareen .

Situated within the transmission is a 38 kW electric motor and clutch where the torque converter should be. Hyundais clever idea of putting the hybrid drive guts within the transmission  something they call a TransmissionMounted Electrical Device TMED  works the same as any other hybrid, but with improved fuel economy via a larger electric motor. Plus, youve got to say thats pretty smart packaging.The traditional ICE part of the hybrid system produces 154 horsepower and 140 lbft. of torque. Add in the electric motor and you get a further 38 kW 51 horsepower and another 151 lbft. of torque. Net power comes up at 193 horsepower at 6,000 rpm. Economywise, with a Sonata Hybrid SE youll get 39 mpg in the city, 45 on the highway, and a combined figure of 42. If you add that all up, you can go for around 650 miles under typical driving conditions. ChoiceThe lithiumion polymer battery pack capacity is good for 1.76 kWh and the whole shebang fits under the trunk floor. Ergo, lots of trunk space, a flat trunk floor, and 6040 splitfolding rear seats. Total cargo volume for the Sonata Hybrid is 13.3 cubic feet.Sonata Plugin Hybrid The Plugin Hybrid is similar to the regular Sonata Hybrid, but with the benefit of extended allelectric travel. Theres a 9.8 kWh lithiumion polymer battery pack which is more than five times larger than the Sonata Hybrids battery. According to the EPA, the Sonata Plugin Hybrid has an allelectric range of 27 miles, and it can be recharged in less than three hours with a leveltwo charger. Which, if you think about this, allows you to commute to work, park the thing, plug it in for a recharge, and then drive it home without burning a drop of gas. And hey, if youve got to head out of town for a long weekend, youve got plenty of range thanks to the gasoline engine. Total estimated range is a remarkable 590 miles.The Plugin Hybrid has the same sixspeed automatic with Hyundais TMED in place of the torque converter again, only this time the electric motor is a 50 kW beast. That 50 kW electric motor puts out 32 percent more power versus the Sonata Hybrid. The plugin hybrid uses the same ICE as the Sonata Hybrid, and the total system output is 202 horsepower at 6,000 rpm. To compliment the performance, the chassis gets some nips and tucks with a stiffer front antiroll bar and a more rigid rear trailingarm design with retuned bushings.Notable Features Other highlights for the 2018 Sonatas include a new frontrear fascia design, a new grille, hood, front fenders, rear deck lid, headlights, and taillights. There are new 16inch and 17inch ecospoke wheel designs, along with new LED headlights that have a trick cornering Dynamic Bending Light DBL function. The interior has a new instrument panel, center stack, steering wheel, wireless phone charging, and rear USB charge port.Safety gadgets By the ton. Theres standard BlindSpot Detection, Rear CrossTraffic Alert, Lane Change Assist, a newly available Automatic Emergency Braking system, and Lane Keep Assist.Manufacturing  Availability The 2018 Sonata Hybrids will be produced in Asan, Korea. The Hybrid will be in Hyundai dealers by the first quarter of 2018 and Plugins will show up in the second quarter.Tony Borroz has spent his entire life racing antique and sports cars. He is the author of Bricks  Bones: The Endearing Legacy and NittyGritty Phenomenon of The Indy 500, available in paperback or Kindle format . 2018 Sonata Hybrid Gallery Photos  Source: Hyundai Motor America.

53 Chicago 2019 Mayoral Elections Chicago 2019 Mayoral Elections Don Rose 23 January 2018 One Comment Lets take a shutdown breather to check out the eternal question, will Rahm Emanuel be reelected mayor Though the city election is only a year away, a prospective scenario is shaping up. Emanuel is almost certain to run. Hes out there regularly announcing new programsand, as usual, announcing their immediate success. Hes pushing hard to land the jobsrich Amazon headquarters and the recently announced Apple campus. Chicago is one of Amazons20 finalist cities. Hes working especially hard in the African American communities where he is considered vulnerable because of his presumed role in the coverup of the killing of Laquan McDonald by a Chicago policeman. The video of the killing was withheld for close to a year, until after his 2015 election campaign when he was forced into a runoff against Jesus Chuy Garcia. Emanuel won the African American vote substantially thanks to an endorsement and commercials by thenPresident Barack Obama, but many wonder whether even Obamas magic can repair Emanuels negative image in black neighborhoods. Thus far there is only one declared candidate against him: Troy Anthony LaRiviere, the outspoken principal of a highly rated public school who was fired for his political activitiesnotably supporting and making social media videos for Garcia. LaRiviere, an African American, was immediately elected head of the principals association and, with Garcia, pushed hard for Bernie Sanders in 2016. This helped him immeasurably in the progressive community, making him the current favorite to unite blacks and white progressives now that Garcia has opted to run for congress and is the overwhelming favorite to replace Luis Gutierrez. On the horizon, though undeclared, are Garry McCarthy, the chief of police thrown under the bus by Emanuel in the wake of the McDonald disclosures, and Bridget Gainer, a smart, well regarded Cook County Commissioner, long itching for higher office. McCarthy was not especially popular among the citys copsthough he gets sympathy because the lessliked Emanuel doublecrossed him after publicly supporting him. McCarthy talked police reformbut it was mostly talk. He should have a strong base on the citys conservative northwest and southwest where cops and firefighters are clustered and the old Machines strongest leaders, who never really liked Emanuel, remain powerful. Gainer is the least known of the quartet, but is pushing herself forward more and more. Her northside district encompasses several of Emanuels strongest wards and is generally considered an Emanuel ally. Thus many wonder whether she will actually take him onbut if she does, and gains any traction, she could scoop thousands of votes from his base, especially among newly activated women. This lineup, chopping away conservative and uppermiddleclass white vote blocs from Emanuel makes LaRiviere a likely prospect for a runoff if he consolidates the African American voteand especially if Garcia and his allies line up substantial Latino support to reciprocate for his efforts in 2015. If there is Emanuel fatigue out there and McCarthy catches fire, the mayor could even wind up out of the running. On the other hand, if he lands either Amazon or Apple, he could win handily. Additions to or subtractions from the lineup may change the equation.  Don Rose is a regular columnist for the Chicago Daily Observer One Comment  Observant said: A possible preemptive strike has been fired against Cook County Commissioner Bridget Gainer. An article appeared in the SunTimes highlighting her absenteeism at the Cook County Board of Commissioners. According to the story, Gainer missed 32 of Board meetings and committee meetings  the most absences of any of the commissioners.  23 January 2018 at 10:26 pm Leave your response Add your comment below, or trackback from your own site.

57 Bulls hope Rising Stars Challenge is taste of what&amp;apos;s to come - Chicago Tribune The day after Lauri Markkanen almost made coach Fred Hoiberg pass out, the unflappable Bulls rookie acted as if nothing happened.He had a good spirit about him, Kris Dunn recalled. He didnt brag or act cocky. He just came back to work.Markkanen and Dunn enjoyed the fruits of their first and secondyear labors Friday night at Staples Center in Los Angeles, competing against each other as the World team defeated the U.S. group 155124 in the Rising Stars Challenge to kick off NBA AllStar weekend.Markkanen finished with 15 points and six rebounds in 22 minutes for the World team, while Dunn, in just his second game action since his nasty fall and concussion Jan. 17, had nine points, five assists and three steals in 19 minutes for the U.S.But perhaps the defining moment of their season came just more than a month earlier all the way on the other coast, at New Yorks Madison Square Garden on Jan. 10.Thats the night Markkanen dunked all over Enes Kanter and sank eight 3pointers en route to his seasonhigh 33 points. Thats also the night Dunn proved his perseverance and prowess at closing by sinking the goahead basket in double overtime despite missing 14 of his first 17 shots.And that was the night Hoiberg lightheartedly said Markkanens highlightreel dunk almost made him pass out.Im surprised with his athletic ability, Dunn said this week. You wouldnt think he could rise the way he can, but he has a lot of athletic ability. Hes a phenomenal shooter.But what makes him good is his confidence. I mean, to do what he did at Madison Square Garden, youre not going to find too many people who can do that being a rookie.Dunn actually was more impressed with what happened the next day.He was ready to move on to the next one, Dunn said. I think thats good about a player like Lauri  dont get too high, dont get too low. Of course youre going to look at the dunk a couple of times. Why wouldnt youMarkkanen, billed as a shooter, is more into dunks than one might think. As the morning shootaround wound down that day at Madison Square Garden, he asked the yettodebut Zach LaVine to attempt a throughthelegs baseline dunk that LaVine missed on his first try so Markkanen could film it on his phone.He takes pride in his athleticism.I dont think people were expecting that from me, Markkanen said.To hear some say it, expectations were even lower this season for Dunn, who didnt get a sniff of the Rising Stars Challenge last season despite the Timberwolves selecting him fifth overall. Even secondround pick Malcolm Brogdon, the eventual Rookie of the Year, snagged an invitation.There were plenty of armchair critics who already had labeled Dunn a bust after his underwhelming rookie season with the Timberwolves. Funny thing is, the president of basketball operations who traded him didnt fall in that category.I felt he was going to have a great year this year, Tom Thibodeau , also the Timberwolves coach, said.Thibodeau based this on the exit meeting he had with Dunn after last season and Dunns response to it, which basically was, in a decision that Thibodeau always chooses, to work harder.Kris is a very intelligent kid, Thibodeau said. Hes a tough kid, stubborn in a good way, and he was highly motivated.The defensive part of it, he had that coming in. The offensive part, he put a lot of work into it and has played very well.So well that Dunn has emerged as the Bulls best closer.He has that clutch gene, Hoiberg said.In the grand scheme of things, Friday night was a small cherry on the sundae. If the Bulls rebuild is going to take flight, Dunn, Markkanen and LaVine need to start earning berths in the grownup AllStar Game on Sunday.But Friday night also marked a measure of vindication for Dunn, which is why he took his family with him to enjoy AllStar weekend. And the night also continued a seemingly seamless rookie season for Markkanen, 20, who never seems fazed by anything even as his exploits, such as his dunk on Kanter in January, cause a stir.Hes a rock, Hoiberg said. His overall confidence has been very impressive. The way he can bounce back from a tough performance and perform at a high level the next game, thats not easy to do when youre a rookie and you cant buy a drink yet.He does so many little things, and hes a great teammate. On some other teams, you could have some animosity for a rookie to get the attention hes getting. But guys are genuinely happy for him.kcjohnson@chicagotribune.comTwitter @kcjhoop5 things to watch during the Bulls remaining 25 games The NBA must sever ties with Wynn hotels in wake of sexual harassment allegations Kris Dunn and Lauri Markkanen relish AllStar weekend together Ice dancer Gabriella Papadakis holds up despite wardrobe malfunction nightmare We need to know the names of those four racists ejected from the Blackhawks game Olympics winners and losers: NBC, Johnny Weir, Nathan Chen, Winnie the Pooh and more Privacy Policy Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Coaches Kris Dunn Basketball Fred Hoiberg Zach LaVine Tom Thibodeau Chicago Bulls
58 MLB owners hopeful of fixing pace of play without showdown - Chicago Arizona Diamondbacks owner Ken Kendrick is hoping Major League Baseball and the players association can work out a deal to improve pace of play without imposing changes on the union unilaterally.Commissioner Rob Manfred has long vowed to put new rules in place for the upcoming season with or without an agreement, but says his preference is for a deal and he is willing to negotiate the changes involving a pitch clock or limits on mound visits.We need to improve the pace of play and as the Commissioner said very well we need to really try to do it as partners with the players because that will make it work better than if Rob made a decision to do it on his own, Kendrick said Wednesday after the first of two days of owners meetings near Beverly Hills.MLB has the right to implement the proposal it made last offseason, which includes a 30second clock between batters and a 20second clock between pitches that would reset when a pitcher steps off the rubber and when he makes or feints a pickoff throw, according to details obtained by the AP.Nineinning games averaged a record 3 hours, 5 minutes during the 2017 regular season and 3:29 during the postseason. Players have resisted a pitch clock while appearing slightly more amenable to limits on mound visits.The absence of a clock is both a blessing and a curse, Kendrick said. Its more the pace of how the game flows and there are times when it doesnt flow well. Its our responsibility to the fans to try to help that. Theres a lot of interest within baseball and I think on the players side as well.Manfred is expected to address the issue when he speaks at the conclusion of the meetings Thursday.Kendrick met with some of his fellow owners to discuss the effect of the new tax laws on player trades and pending action in the Supreme Court over legalized gambling.Thats an area of concern for us, he said.Among the other owners in attendance were Fred Wilpon of the Mets, Mark Attanasio of the Brewers, Mark Walter of the Dodgers and Tom Werner of the Red Sox.The freeagent market has been slower than usual this winter, with 51 players finalizing contracts as of Wednesday.Definitely an anomaly, said Neil Leibman, chairman of the ownership committee for the Texas Rangers. Theres a lot of teams looking at next years freeagent market, which is going to be the largest in a long time.Attanasio agreed the market has slowed, but said, The season isnt over yet. Its sort of like the seventh inning.Jordan Howards criticism of basic offense highlights Bears complex problem Bulls acquire 1stround pick, Omer Asik from Pelicans for Nikola Mirotic Josh McDaniels, John DeFilippo both praise Bears and Ryan Pace for hiring process Privacy Policy Major League Baseball Arizona Diamondbacks Milwaukee Brewers Texas Rangers
59 Off-duty police officer fatally shot in downtown Chicago CHICAGO  An offduty police officer was shot and killed at the James R. Thompson Center in downtown Chicago on Tuesday afternoon, authorities said. The officer was later identified as 53yearold Cmdr. Paul Bauer of the citys 18th District.Tactical officers were on routine patrol Tuesday and observed an individual acting suspiciously around 2:30 p.m. When they tried speak with the individual, a physical struggle ensued and the person escaped, Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson said during a news conference.Bauer, a 31year veteran, was in the area, overheard police radio transmission and confronted the individual, Johnson said. An armed physical confrontation ensued and Bauer was shot multiple times, he added.Johnson said the suspect is in custody and police have recovered the weapon.I ask the citizens of this city keep the Bauer family in their prayers, Johnson said, adding that he would meet with his wife and daughter. Its a difficult day for us. We will get through it. I ask the city for their thoughts and prayers  any loss of life is tragic.Witnesses told CBS Chicago that police officers warned residents to get off the streets shortly after shots were fired, and began blocking off the streets and entrances to the Thompson Center.They actually had us locked in Walgreens, one person in the area said. They taped it off, so we couldnt get out. Just for a minute, and then they all hopped in their cop cars, and they all went south on Clark.Gov. Bruce Rauner tweeted condolences to Bauers family and colleagues Tuesday.Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and colleagues of the officer tragically lost in a shooting at the Thompson Center today.

61 Snow blankets Chicago as winter storm sweeps U.S. Midwest | News | WIBQ Snow blankets Chicago as winter storm sweeps U.S. Midwest Friday, February 09, 2018 2:45 p.m. EST Vehicles covered in snow are seen in Chicago, U.S., February 9, 2018 in this picture obtained from social media. TWITTER@MUMBLESNMAKEUPvia By Suzannah Gonzales CHICAGO Reuters  A winter storm swept across the northern U.S. Midwest on Friday, dumping up to nine inches 23 cm of snow on Chicago and snarling hundreds of flights as it rolled east to threaten New York state and New England. Chicagos metropolitan area was blanketed with its heaviest snowfall since at least late 2016 as the storm put an icy grip on much of Wisconsin, northern Illinois and Michigan. The snow caused dozens of crashes on icy Chicago expressways as residents of the thirdbiggest U.S. city struggled to get to work and to dig out from a storm system that had stretched from Montana to Michigan. I hate you, Chicago Ieva Urbietyte, a 25yearold customer service representative, said she thought while cleaning snow off her car in the Windy City. Thankfully we dont have to do this all the time. Weather forecasters in Detroit warned that snowfall there could surpass one inch 2.5 cm an hour as the system headed east. At the Argus Farm Stop in nearby Ann Arbor, Michigan, several customers arrived on skis, and store manager Laura Barch said she was eager to get into her snowshoes. I feel like this is going to be the one day out of the year to use them, said Barch. This is the first real winter weve had in several years. Wind chill temperatures were expected to drop below 0 Fahrenheit 18 C in many areas across the upper Midwest. The central and northern Rockies also will see heavy snow, the National Weather Service said. City officials announced school closures in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee because of the weather. National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley said on Friday that the system was likely to drop another four or five inches 10 or 12.5 cm of snow on the Midwest by the evening as it headed east toward New England. The storm could dump up to a foot 30 cm of snow in New York state as it picks up moisture off the Great Lakes, he added. About 1,500 U.S. flights were canceled, with about a third of flights into or out of Chicago and Detroit airports called off, according to FlightAware.com , which tracks airline traffic. Winter weather this week killed people in accidents in the Midwest, including six in Iowa, two in Missouri and one in Montana, local media in those states reported.

62 Rauner wants lawmakers&#39; help to cut state workers&#39; health insurance by $470 million - Chicago Tribune For the fourth time in as many years, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner has pointed to state workers health care as a way to save money, but this time hes asking lawmakers to help him get it done.The governors budget proposal unveiled Wednesday calls for cutting 470 million spent on public worker health insurance, an idea unions and the courts have blocked before.This time, Rauner is asking the General Assembly to change the law that requires health benefits for public workers be negotiated through collective bargaining. It could be a tall order, though, as Democratic Senate President John Cullerton has already dismissed the idea as something thats just not going to happen.For more than three years, Rauner and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union have been in a contract negotiations stalemate, which has kept state workers current health benefits unchanged.That means state, university and community college employees have continued to receive benefits in which the state picks up 83 percent of the cost of their insurance premiums. When copays and deductibles are factored in, state workers pay less than onequarter of their total health care costs, according to state data. The plan is considered platinum plus under the Affordable Care Act s metallic rating system that ranks plans as either bronze, silver, gold or platinum.Rauner wants to get the states portion of health care costs down to 60 percent, with employees paying the remaining 40 percent. He contends the state cant afford to offer a more generous health plan, given Illinois ongoing financial troubles. Such a shift would lower the plan rankings to silver or gold, depending on how the premiums and other costsharing were distributed.We recommend rightsizing employee health insurance plans so that government compensation is more in line with what the taxpayers have who are paying for it, Rauner said in his Wednesday budget address. State government needs to do what every employer in Illinois has done over the last 10 years: Get its health care costs under control. Taxpayers shouldnt have to pay for government health insurance policies that are richer than ones they can afford for themselves.AFSCME Council 31 Executive Director Roberta Lynch slammed the proposal as recycling wellworn assaults on public service workers and retirees and said the governor was looking to the wrong people for help in righting the states finances.He wants to impose unaffordably high health care costs, undermine retirement security and weaken union rights, Lynch said. All this from a wealthy CEO whos never asked his fellow millionaires and billionaires to do their part to address our states very real problems.Rauner also will have a tough time persuading lawmakers to go along with the idea. Democrats who control both the state House and Senate tend to be allied with organized labor, and some Republicans who represent districts with high numbers of union households also can be reluctant to vote against those interests.If he wants health care savings, he needs to take charge and negotiate with the workers union, Cullerton said. Thats an executive responsibility.In past years, Rauner has envisioned making the health care cuts on his own, and hes baked the anticipated cost savings into his budget proposals. That money has never materialized, though, because Rauner and AFSCME have never agreed to a contract.Over the nearly three years since AFSCMEs contract has been up for renewal, Rauner and lawmakers also havent set aside enough money to pay for the health care program, so the state is about 1.7 billion behind in paying claims. And it owes more than 500 million in interest, much of it from the bills that piled up since Rauner took office, according to data provided by the comptrollers office.Had Rauner and the union been able to reach an agreement in their contract talks over the past few years, the state might have been able to save on some of those costs.AFSCME contends that it offered in contract talks that workers could pay 8.5 percent higher premiums than theyre paying now. But the Rauner administration contends that move wouldnt save enough money.And the offer only came after a state labor board ruled that the two sides were past the point of being able to negotiate a deal and that Rauner should be allowed to impose his final contract terms, with the union having the option to strike. AFSCME turned to a state appellate court, which blocked Rauner from imposing his contract terms while it considers the case. It is still ongoing.In the years leading up to the impasse ruling, the two sides remained far apart on the issue, according to an administrative law judge at the state Labor Relations Board who analyzed the negotiations.The judge found that Rauners negotiating team consistently indicated its need to save hundreds of millions of dollars in health insurance costs and always pushed for a costsharing deal that would drop the states share to 60 percent, while the union consistently indicated its unwillingness to reach an agreement that resulted in employees paychecks being significantly smaller. In its opening offer, the union pushed for a plan that kept premiums where they are and added benefits, making it more expensive for the state, the judge found.Rauner on Wednesday cast the health insurance expenses, along with pension costs, as makeorbreak issues for Illinois finances, warning that inaction on them would mean our finances will continue to deteriorate, our economy will remain sluggish and our tax burdens will stay high and keep rising.kgeiger@chicagotribune.com Twitter @kimgeiger RELATED Rauner budget proposal at odds with reelection rhetoric  Home health care workers sue Rauner for withholding 48centanhour pay hike  Drinking alcohol more important than exercise for living past 90, study says Sylvester Stallone is not dead  at least thats what he says Sorry Elizabeth Swaney, Olympics should be reserved for the best athletes   Healthcare Policies and Laws Health Insurance Bruce Rauner John Cullerton Illinois General Assembly Affordable Care Act

66 Reborn and revitalized, the Minnesota Orchestra returns to Chicago Reborn and revitalized, the Minnesota Orchestra returns to Chicago Mon Jan 29, 2018 at 11:43 am By Tim Sawyier Osmo Vnsk conducted the Minnesota Orchestra Sunday afternoon at Symphony Center. On Sunday afternoon the Minnesota Orchestra returned to Orchestra Hall for the first time in over five decades. The ensemble has persevered through an extended musician lockout and dire financial challenges in recent years. With that drama well behind them now, under the leadership of music director Osmo Vnsk, the Minnesotans delivered bracing readings of repertory cornerstones in a showing well worth the wait. The matinee performancethe second and final installment of the seasons Symphony Center Presents Orchestra Seriesopened with the music of Jean Sibelius. Vnsk is unsurpassed in the interpretation of his countrymans oeuvre, as demonstrated in his deft handling of the Finnish composers tone poem En Saga . The hushed opening string arpeggios created an icy stasis, below which Vnsk artfully shaped long churning lines. Principal violist Rebecca Albers solos were urgently breathless throughout, and Gabriel Campos Zamoras elegiac clarinet solo in the closing section brought this deeply psychological work to a reflective close. Perhaps most impressive here and throughout the afternoon was the focused sonority of Minnesota string sections, which had a dark, earthy timbre, even at incredibly soft dynamics. The programs centerpiece was Tchaikovskys Piano Concerto No. 1 with Inon Barnatan as the solo protagonist. There is little music more familiar than the first five minutes of this beloved work, yet between Vnsk and Barnatan the famed introduction fell somewhat flat. Tchaikosky marks this movement Allegro non troppo e molto maestoso, but soloist and conductor erred too far on the side of the qualifiers and lost the Allegro. Their expansive, rounded approach compromised the openings ardor, resulting in a treacly wash. After this sentimentalized opening, the performance safely found its footing. Mozart was Tchaikovskys favorite composer and Barnatans approach was in many ways Mozartean, his playing incisive and lean. At times one wanted more force from the Israeli pianist, particularly in the opening movement. Still, there are enough pianists who storm through this score with bombast to spare, and his more restrained approach was ultimately compelling. The transparent Andantino benefited most, its middle scherzando section fleet and acrobatic. Barnatan provided ample brio in the closing Allegro con fuoco, giving blistering treatment to the finales pyrotechnics. The second half was devoted to Beethovens Symphony No. 7, which received an invigorating reading from Vnsk and the Minnesotans. The expansive introduction was well paced, and the ensuing Vivace light on its feet yet also visceral in impact. Throughout Vnsk astutely highlighted details in the backing string parts, infusing vitality into the familiar orchestral textures. The Allegretto also showcased the exquisite playing of the Minnesota string sections, especially at the softest dynamic levels, which were barely audible yet resonated even in Orchestra Halls dry acoustic. The Presto had ample vitality, and its trios were imbued with a regal sheen from the whole ensemble. The closing Allegro con brio went with incendiary abandon, bringing the program to an emphatic close and receiving a deserved standing ovation. By way of an encore Vnsk returned to Sibelius for the composers Dance Intermezzo, Op. 45 No. 2. This bonbon made for a charming, threeminute sendoff, highlighted by characterful solos from the orchestras woodwind principals.
67 Chicago trader is accused of stealing $2 million in cryptocurrency in city&#39;s first bitcoin fraud case A 24yearold Chicago trader has been charged with fraud for allegedly stealing 2 million in bitcoin and another cryptocurrency from his employer to cover personal trading losses.It is the first criminal prosecution in Chicago involving digital currencies, according to federal prosecutors.Joseph Kim appeared in U.S. District Court in Chicago on Friday, flanked by his attorneys, as U.S. Magistrate Judge Daniel G. Martin presided over the brief hearing. Kim, wearing a rumpled blazer and dark pants, was charged with one count of wire fraud. He did not enter a plea.Kim was an assistant trader for Consolidated Trading, a Chicago firm that recently formed a group to trade in increasingly popular cryptocurrencies, according to the complaint. From September to November, the complaint claims Kim transferred at least 2 million of the firms bitcoin and Litecoin for his personal use, and then made false statements to conceal the theft, until it was ultimately uncovered by Consolidateds management.Kims bond was set at 100,000, and he was limited to travel between northern Illinois and Arizona, where he has a residence. He relinquished his passport, and agreed to other restrictions as part of the bond deal, including not communicating with his former coworkers.Bitcoin has seen a meteoric rise  and a fair amount of volatility  in the last year as its popularity became more mainstream and the price of a single bitcoin surged from about 1,000 in early 2017 to around 15,000 at years end. The price now stands around 10,000. Litecoin is valued at about 220.In December, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the CBOE Futures Exchange became the first traditional exchanges to begin trading cryptocurrency futures, lending legitimacy to the digital asset and opening the door for more traditional traders to bet on its future.sbomkamp@chicagotribune.comTwitter @SamWillTravelDog food withdrawn over euthanasia drug concerns State Farm cutting IT workers at Bloomington headquarters Another 7,000 apartments expected in downtown Chicago within 2 years Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Theft Bitcoin

73 Hoover’s two-hit shutout pushes No. 8 LSU past Illinois-Chicago Save Amid first game jitters, senior pitcher Carley Hoovers dominance on the mound brought No. 8 LSU to a 30 season opening win over IllinoisChicago. Hoover dominated on the mound, only allowing two hits and counting 12 strikeouts. She didnt allow a baserunner until the fourth inning, when she walked one batter. Junior catcher Michaela Schlattman was working real well for me, Hoover said. I trusted her behind the plate. She did great out there for her first outing and Im excited to see what other catchers and pitchers do this season. LSU coach Beth praised Hoovers ability to make it look easy against an IllinoisChicago team that held their own throughout the game. Behind Hoover, the rest of the defense was solid. Four new faces stepped on the field, including junior second baseman Becca Schulte, freshman Shelbi Sunseri, freshman Taryn Antoine and Schlattman. Schlattman steps behind the plate following the graduation of former LSU allAmerican Sahvanna Jaquish and found a way to control the game and the team. I liked seeing the way the team competed, Torina said. Michaela did a great job behind the plate. Its nice to see the freshman get some at bats. Im sure theyd like to see some different results but every atbat matters and every time they see the field, theyre going to be better. Both teams remained scoreless until the fifth inning when LSU broke it open with a series of sacrifice bunts. I think it was just a little bit of first game nervousness, junior Shemiah Sanchez said. Everybody coming out tight and scared to mess up. Soon as we got going I think it was pretty good. After Schulte walked, junior shortstop Amber Serrett bunted for LSUs first hit of the game. Another sacrifice bunt by Sunseri put runners on second and third. Antoine then singled down the right field line to put LSU up 10 in the bottom of the fifth. The Tigers took complete control of the game in the bottom the the sixth, scoring two more runs off an RBI groundout by sophomore Amanda Doyle and an RBI double by Sanchez. It was really fun to just mesh with everyone out on the field, Hoover said. I think opening night bring a lot of nervousness and jitters and its almost like we can play softball now. Im glad thats out of the way, we got the win and we can move on. LSU returns to Tiger Park on Friday to kick off the annual Tiger Classic against UTArlington at 5 p.m.

78 Chicago Bulls: Nikola Mirotic thanks city of Chicago and Bulls&#39; fans Chicago Bulls: Nikola Mirotic thanks city of Chicago and Bulls fansK.C. Johnson of the Chicago Tribune reported the Bulls will also send a secondround draft pick and will receive a firstround pick from the Pelicans with the option to swap secondround selections in a future draft.Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN was told by sources that the two teams are finalizing a trade.Originally, Mirotic was to be sent to New Orleans in exchange for big man Omer Asik and a firstround pick.Mirotic is averaging a careerbest 16.8 points and 6.4 rebounds. He can be a free agent in the offseason, and theres nearly no chance Chicago wouldve exercised his club option. During his first stay, Asik was a serviceable backup to Joakim Noah he averaged eight points and 2.3 blocks per 36 minutes through his first couple of seasons in Chicago.Nuggets Gary Harris nails gamewinning triple to crush ThunderThe Nuggets will now set their sights on the Golden State Warriors who will pay a visit to Pepsi Center on Saturday. It also featured Paul George hitting a insane clutch threepointer with a couple seconds left in the game to tie it.Fighting through the awkwardness and resentment, it has been understood and seen from his play that Mirotic did everything in his power to act as a professional after the unfortunate events, but in the end, he wanted out and the Bulls made it happen. Quickly and consistently, it became evident the Bulls would work to trade Mirotic, who sought elsewhere a starting spot he lost to rookie Lauri Markkanen after winning it in training camp. On the season, they are 1411 when he plays and 422 when he doesnt. He was making 17.8 million in the final season of a threeyear, 50 million deal.But Nikola Mirotic might not be the Pelicans only get this season. This type of deal allows us to put Paul and Cris out on the floor more than theyve been all season long. And thats not even counting Mirotic potentially vetoing this deal. Hes the only active player from the Balkan country, with the most recently retired native being Nikola Pekovic, who last played in the league in 2016.Paxson also mentioned that point guard Cameron Payne should be recovered from his foot injury shortly after the AllStar break, and the Bulls want to take a look at him as well. That means Mirotic would likely be on the move again. Id say probably not. Still, New Orleans is in a bind and this is potentially the bestcase scenario for salvaging their season. But the ripple effects  who picks up the waived players, how this affects the Monroe pursuit and the NBA Draft implications  are all yet to be determined.

81 &#39;Frasier&#39; star, Chicago theater staple Mahoney dies at 77 Frasier star and Chicago theater veteran John Mahoney, the Britishborn actor who called Oak Park home, has died.He was 77.Mahoney, a member of the Steppenwolf Theatre Company for 39 years, was in hospice when he died Sunday due to complications from cancer, according to a statement from the theater. He made his final stage appearance there last fall in The Rembrandt.While he appeared in numerous Chicago area theater productions over the years, Mahoney was best known for playing cranky Martin Crane  father of Kelsey Grammers title character  on the NBC sitcom Frasier from 1993 to 2004. The role earned him two Emmy nominations. Recently, he made guest appearances on TVs Hot in Cleveland and Foyles War.Despite his success in Hollywood, the Oak Park resident remained committed to theater, specifically Chicago theater. And he embodied the citys muscular, nofrills acting style.It was a true privilege to work with him ... He was truly great, said BJ Jones, artistic director for Skokies Northlight Theatre where Mahoneys credits included Better Late, A Life and The Outgoing Tide.A longtime friend and collaborator, Jones last directed Mahoney in 2014s Chapatti. In a 2014 interview with this newspaper, Mahoney characterized his work with Jones as his best.He gave us a tremendous gift with his artistry, said Jones, who described Mahoneys performances as heroic.There were times when he dealt with health issues and he would power through so bravely, because he would rather be on stage in front of an audience eight times a week than in front of a camera, Jones said.Jones said being a star never mattered to Mahoney, who earned a 1986 Tony Award for his performance in John Guares The House of Blue Leaves and whose film career included roles in the Chicagoset thriller Primal Fear, as well as Say Anything ..., Barton Fink and The American President.He was more crazy about being an actor, Jones said. Hed be so jazzed about the connection he had with an audience.Steppenwolf canceled an opening night performance of You Got Older Monday and issued a statement on Facebook. John was a beloved member of our Steppenwolf family who was known for his extraordinary kindness, generosity of spirit and quick smile, the statement read. He performed in more than 30 Steppenwolf productions  from his breakthrough role in Orphans in 1985 to most recently The Rembrandt this past September. Johns impact on this institution, on Chicago theatre, and the world of arts and entertainment is great and will endure.Jones remembered his friend as a sweet, generous man who routinely treated the entire Northlight cast and crew to dinner, during which they all swapped stories.He was an actor down to his core, but above all of that he was just a human being, said Jones. Such a mensch. The Associated Press contributed to this report.  Celebrity Oak Park Chicago Obituaries Theater

86 Illinois State Board of Education to revamp PARCC exams Illinois State Board of Education to revamp PARCC exams Originally published February 9, 2018 at 10:19 am Share story The Associated Press The Associated Press CHICAGO AP  The Illinois State Board of Education is planning to transform third to eighthgrade state exams, aiming to shorten the tests, get results faster and switch to a format that adjusts the difficulty of test questions. The Chicago Tribune reports that the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers exam has had issues since its launch in 2015. School officials criticized the long hours of the tests. Complaints from parents led to an optout movement that kept students from getting tested. The state has pulled the exam from the roster of high school assessments following complaints from administrators who say the exams took away from instruction. Any changes to the exam wont affect high schools. Most Read Stories

88 Chicago Cubs Rumors: Yu Darvish Still On Cubs’ Radar But They Trail Brewers February 4, 2018 Chicago Cubs Rumors: Yu Darvish Still On Cubs Radar But They Trail Brewers The MLB pitching phenomenon still has a number of teams trying to acquire him with Chicago among them. Matt Slocum  AP Images Matt Couden There have been a number of teams mentioned in the MLB rumors that are vying for pitcher Yu Darvishs services, and the Chicago Cubs still have him on their radar. Thats the latest word from various sources that suggest Chicago still is looking to add to the depth of their pitching as they pursue another postseason run. However, Chicago may have a tough time bringing Darvish on board based on their reported expectations and several other MLB teams may still be ahead of them in the Yu Darvish sweepstakes this offseason. On Thursday, Fan Rag Sports  Jon Heyman gave an update on various teams offseason situations including the Chicago Cubs. With pitching depth an offseason pursuit, Darvish is still on their radar. Heyman noted that the team has hopes that Darvish will be willing to sign with them in lieu of signing with a team giving a higher payout. Since their offer isnt going to be as high as other teams, Heyman says that the Milwaukee Brewers could be ahead of Chicago in terms of bringing Darvish on board their roster. However, he also points out the fact that playing for a contender like the Cubs in a great city like Chicago could be all the reason that Darvish needs. Yu Darvish is still on the Cubs radar but theyre likely behind the Brewers in terms of their offer. Matt Slocum  AP Images While the Cubs have Darvish on the radar, they may need to settle on a different option if money lures him elsewhere. In a recent interview with ESPN s Jesse Rogers, Chicago Cubs General Manager Jed Hoyer reiterated his teams need for pitching. On the pitching side, I like the additions, but were still looking to add depth. Thats an annual thing you think about. You prepare for injuries even if some years you go unscathed. While Hoyer didnt specifically mention Yu Darvish, a recent Chicago SunTimes poll from Steve Greenberg asked fans which pitcher fans wanted most on the roster. The options were Jake Arrieta, Alex Cobb, and Yu Darvish . Darvish finished second with 37 percent of the total votes while Arrieta was first with 41 percent. In such a close vote, Greenberg contended that maybe fans were giving Darvish a lot of votes due to believing that the grass is greener with him on the roster. Still, Darvish could boost the pitching rotation as the Cubs try to battle teams such as Washington and Los Angeles next season. The Dodgers, who were on the cusp of winning this past seasons World Series, are also considered a team that could keep Darvish as part of their rotation. As theyll be attempting to make another run and are amongst the favorites to win it all, one would have to think that if they can offer more money than Chicago has on the table, Darvish will remain on board. He may even have redemption on his mind by staying with Los Angeles next season. Lately, the MLB offseason has been relatively quiet since bigger moves took place including Giancarlo Stanton and Andrew McCutchen moving to new teams. However, once Yu Darvishs decision is finally made, it could shake things up again. It will definitely give more of an edge to one teams pitching staff next season as they look to make their push. It will be interesting to see if its the Chicago Cubs who are able to sway him to join the roster, or if another teams monetary offer is just too good to pass up.

94 Patriots open as favorite over Eagles in Super Bowl - Chicago Tribune Oddsmakers like the chances of Tom Brady winning a sixth Super Bowl ring, making the New England Patriots nearly a touchdown favorite to beat the Philadelphia Eagles .Sports books around Las Vegas opened the Patriots around a 6point favorite Sunday to win their second straight Super Bowl. They also made New England a big favorite to win the Super Bowl next year in Atlanta.But the closest thing to a lock in this gambling city is that betting on this Super Bowl will smash the existing record of 138.5 million set just last year.Sports betting couldnt be more popular than it is now, said Jay Kornegay of the Westgate Las Vegas sports book. That combined with the fan base of the Eagles and the strong economy will mean a record handle on this game.Bookmakers posted their opening lines early in the fourth quarter of the Eagles Vikings game, with lines ranging between 5 and 6 12 points. The overunder in most books for total points scored in the game was 48.Bettors didnt take long to weigh in themselves, with one gambler taking the 6 points and putting a big bet on the Eagles at the South Point resort before their rout of the Minnesota Vikings was even over.Our first bet was 10,000 on the Eagles, said Jimmy Vaccaro, oddsmaker at the South Point.Bettors jammed into sports books Sunday for the two conference championship games, with millions wagered in person and millions more bet on phone apps. Bookmakers had a good day, with most winning money on both games.That shouldnt change in the Super Bowl, where bookmakers have turned a profit every time except the 2008 game when the New York Giants upset the previously unbeaten and 12point favorite Patriots.At the Westgate, Kornegay said the opening line of the Patriots minus5.5 points was made knowing there would be money coming in from both the Eagles rabid fan base and by bettors who simply have a dislike for the dominance of Brady and the Patriots.This is the only event where we make a line that depends on public opinion, Kornegay said. Theres so much more money from the public on this game than you would get from the socalled sharks. They come in here and they just dont want to root for the Patriots.Unlike the games preceding it, a lot of the money on the Super Bowl comes from socalled prop bets that often crossover to other sports. Some of the bigger sports books will put up several hundred prop bets later this week that will include the coin flip and other possibilities that having nothing to do with the final score of the game.Its much easier to do lots of props with Brady, Vaccaro said. Either you love him or you hate him. Half the people bet on him to see him win and half bet to see him lose.One of the more popular prop bets is whether there will be a safety in the game, and Vaccaro said about 15,000 was wagered on either side of that prop even before the second game ended Sunday.Oddsmakers at the William Hill chain also made the Patriots a 92 favorite to win next years Super Bowl in Atlanta, followed by the Eagles at 172.Aly Raismans mom rips into Michigan State coach Tom Izzo: Are you a moron Free from Tom Thibodeau, Bulls Zach LaVine in good hands Larry Nassar case shows courage of victims, shamefulness of enablers Privacy Policy Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune New England Patriots Philadelphia Eagles Tom Brady Minnesota Vikings New York Giants

Its been awhile, so Im glad.Heres a hint: His last game was Jan. 28 when the Bulls lost a Sunday afternoon home game to Milwaukee.

Thats the first time I played with a mouthpiece in a basketball game, just a lot of adjustments Ive got to figure out.Lauri Markkanen also was selected to play in the Rising Stars game. He and Dunn would be on opposite sides if they both participate, since the game is a United States vs. the World format.Its going to be fun going against Kris, for the most part, Markkanen said. Hes going to iso me a little bit. We talked about it. So Ill try to hold my own.Trade deadline looms: The NBAs trade deadline is Thursday at 2 p.m., Central time. The Bulls already pulled off the trade everyone expected, sending Nikola Mirotic to New Orleans for a firstround pick and three players.Rookie Lauri Markkanen shared his thoughts on watching Mirotic leave from afar, since Markkanen was home for the birth of his child when the trade occurred.He helped me a lot on the court and off the court to adjust to the NBA, Markkanen said. It was tough to see him leave, but weve just got to move on. Hopefully we can meet up at some point.Of the players acquired from New Orleans, center Omer Asik is expected to be a regular member of the team.

Ray, Jr., President, Chicago Theological Seminary Chicago Theological Seminary Dr. Ray brings an incredibly deep understanding of the changing cultural and religious landscape facing theological education. His 30 plus years of experience equip him not only to see the challenges, but to identify and articulate the possibilities ahead, said Norman J. Williams , chair of the Seminarys board of trustees. A renowned theological scholar, Rays appointment has been met with enthusiasm across the seminary world and by theological leaders and the United Church of Christ UCC where he is an ordained minister.Having worked closely with Dr. Ray, I am thrilled to learn that Chicago Theological Seminary has called him as their next president, said Rev. John C. Dorhauer , UCC general minister and president. He brings a solid foundation of theological sophistication and a deep awareness of emerging racial, political, and cultural realities.

We are committed to developing citizens of the future who unabashedly, and unashamedly champion justice, mercy, and the inherent value of every human being, said Dr. Ray. Alice Hunt moved CTS forward with her commitment to innovation. Her inspirational leadership led the Seminary to think differently and execute new models, continued Dr. Ray. Theological education is at a critical juncture, amid downward trends in enrollment, and unconscionable burdens put upon those taking on student debt. Yet, I am certain that we have the tools necessary to confront these challenges and seize the opportunities facing theological education, its institutions, and the students we serve, to make our religiously plural world wiser, more merciful and just than ever before.Prior to being called to lead CTS, Ray served as the Neal F. and Ila A.

The board named Donald C. Clark, Jr. , counselor at law, entrepreneur, retired general counsel for the UCC, and past CTS board chair, as acting president. CTSs executive committee appointed a committee representative of the wider CTS community to conduct the search.

105 Drinking alcohol more important than exercise for living past 90, study says Chicago Tribune Cheers to life  seriously.When it comes to making it into your 90s, booze actually beats exercise, according to a longterm study.The research, led by University of California neurologist Claudia Kawas, tracked 1,700 nonagenarians enrolled in the 90 Study that began in 2003 to explore impacts of daily habits on longevity.Researchers discovered that subjects who drank about two glasses of beer or wine a day were 18 percent less likely to experience a premature death, the Independent reports.Meanwhile, participants who exercised 15 to 45 minutes a day, cut the same risk by 11 percent.I have no explanation for it, but I do firmly believe that modest drinking improves longevity, Kawas stated over the weekend at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual conference in Austin, Texas.Other factors were found to boost longevity, including weight. Participants who were slightly overweight  but not obese  cut their odds of an early death by 3 percent.Its not bad to be skinny when youre young but its very bad to be skinny when youre old, Kawas noted in her address.Subjects who kept busy with a daily hobby two hours a day were 21 percent less likely to die early, while those who drank two cups of coffee a day cut that risk by 10 percent.Further study is needed to determine how habits impact longevity beyond peoples genetic makeups.As alcohol gender gap narrows, womens risk of addiction increasesMixing energy drinks with alcohol may make dangerous cocktailHeres why you shouldnt get a massage after drinking alcoholAhh Valentines Day, the holiday of love.

106 Review: The Humans (Broadway in Chicago) The Humans   Playwright Stephen Karam , also known for Speech and Debate , has been adapting Chekhov of late. His take on The Cherry Orchard went up on Broadway in 2016 the same year The Humans won the Tony Award for Best Play. His film adaptation of The Seagull, starring Annette Bening, is forthcoming this year. This is fitting, as The Humans has very Chekhovian elements: family dynamics, old memories, and differing viewpoints clashing on major and minor levels. Leaving the plays opening night performance in Chicago, I heard several audience members saying, I dont get it. I respectfully disagree: I got it, and then some. Thoughtfully directed by Joe Mantello , the first national tour of the Broadway hit chronicles a family Thanksgiving dinner with realistic  and haunting  results. Struggling composer Brigid Blake  Daisy Eagan  is hosting her family for Thanksgiving in the New York City apartment she shares with her older boyfriend, graduate student Richard  Luis Vega . The duplex is large and slightly offkilter, much like the Blakes themselves. Patriarch Erik  Richard Thomas  dearly loves his youngest daughter but cant understand why she wants to live in such a city, such a flat. Mom Dierdre  Pamela Reed  is busy taking care of her wheelchairbound motherinlaw Momo  Lauren Klein , who is struggling with dementia. Still, Dierdre cant resist little digs at Brigids livinginsin situation. Meanwhile, older sister Aimee  Therese Plaehn  is losing her job due to a chronic illness, and has recently broken up with her longtime girlfriend. As they nibble on appetizers, drink in the Irish way read: a lot, and banter back and forth, the faulty electricity and loud noises of the old apartment building portend a dark undercurrent. Watching The Humans , I realized that there is something eerie about living in an older apartment building, as many of us citydwellers do. Privacy basically doesnt exist. Youre never fully alone, and though this can be comforting, its also a bit disturbing that others are privy to your most intimate moments. Aided by director Mantello and a crack production team, Karams play brings this out brilliantly. As tension builds in the familys interactions, lights go out and neighbors bang from above. The effect is spectacularly unsettling, symbolic without going overboard. David Zinn s scenic design perfectly recreates the creaky floors and dirty windows of a large, cheap urban living space, even showing the thin insulation between floors. Justin Townsend s lighting is letterperfect, especially a creepy final moment involving Brigid and Erik. Ditto Fitz Patton s sound, relatable to anyone whos inhabited a shared living space. The dialogue is wonderfully authentic and even the quippy moments sound like real people talking. When secrets are revealed, its not with a bang but a whimper or several: much like real life. Everyone is wellcast, especially Thomas bestknown as John Boy from The Waltons and Eagan one of the youngestever Tony winners for her performance as Mary Lennox in The Secret Garden . The Humans is heartbreaking, but refreshing in many ways: a play about ordinary folks fumbling through life and navigating its many obstacles. Karams script, Mantellos direction and the excellent production team and cast accurately portray the fears we have, both everyday and existential, that come to a head when crossed with complex familial relationships. The Humans doesnt make a grand statement. It just is, and therein lies the genius. Rating:  The Humans continues through February 11th at Cadillac Palace Theatre , 151 W. Randolph  map . Tickets are 2290,   8007752000 or online at Ticketmaster.com   TheHumansOnBroadway.com . Running time: 90 minutes, no intermission
107 Japan takes the lead in countering China&#39;s Belt and Road Initiative - Chicago Tribune News , now finds itself playing the leading role in pushing back against Chinas grand plans to extend its influence throughout Asia and into Europe. To do so, Tokyo is increasingly joining up with other countries and especially India, launching a 200 billion infrastructure plan, and even boosting its military efforts in the broader Indian Ocean area in what is seen as a deliberate bid to counter Beijings growing heft. The effort even extends as far afield as Eastern and Central Europe, where Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a historic visit just last month.Abe has been very active in proposing an alternative to China in general and the Belt and Road in particular, said Cline Pajon, a Japan expert at the French Institute of International Relations. It serves to complicate Chinas strategic calculus and also maintain a multipolar world as much as possible. Since World War II, Japan has played a largely secondary role to the United States in Asia, sheltering under the American security umbrella while focusing on business. But now that Washington has bailed out of the single biggest project meant to push back against Chinas growing influence in Asia  the TransPacific Partnership TPP trade pact  Japan has been forced in many ways to pick up the slack. Abe appears to be embracing this role. Both times he has led Japan  from 2006 to 2007 and again since 2012  he has sought to make Tokyo a bigger player on the regional stage, even against domestic opposition. In 2016, he launched his own version of a development and security plan for Asia, designed as an explicit alternative to Chinas vision. That includes a deliberate focus on building quality infrastructure, a dig at the perceived flaws of Chinesebuilt projects. These trends were around before Trump, said Robert Dujarric, the director of the Institute of Contemporary Asian Studies at Temple University Japan. But theyve been kicked into overdrive in part to compensate for a lack of U.S. leadership, he said. Dujarric called Japans central and surprising role in salvaging the TPP even without U.S. participation exhibit A. That new role is crystallized in Japans growing strategic partnership with India. The two are working together to develop muchneeded power plants, railroads and port facilities in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar and on Indian Ocean islands. More ambitiously, theyre jointly promoting something called the AsiaAfrica Growth Corridor, an outgrowth of Abes own plan meant to deepen the economic connections between Africa and South and Southeast Asia. Not coincidentally, its positioned as an alternative to Chinas own leapfrogging across the Indian Ocean to East Africa. Japan is concerned about a rising Chinese profile beyond the Western Pacific, and India is equally concerned about the strategic implications of Chinas commercial engagements in its neighborhood, said Darshana Baruah of Carnegie India. These projects are aimed at creating an alternative to Chinas Belt and Road. In many ways, the uptick in Japaneseled plans to develop Asia  through multibilliondollar efforts including the Japan Infrastructure Initiative and the Asian Development Bank  is simply an extension of decades of Japanese overseas assistance and investment in the region. Whats markedly new is Japans effort to extend its economic influence much further afield, precisely to places such as Central and Eastern Europe that have become a focus of Beijings Belt and Road project over the past year. Abes visit in January to the Baltics and three other Eastern European nations  the first ever by a Japanese prime minister  was meant to drum up support for the JapanEU trade deal inked last year. But his visit also included a stop in Serbia  a country that isnt in the EU but which is squarely in the crosshairs of Chinas efforts to win influence through investment. The China factor seems to be a motivation for Japan in Eastern Europe, said FransPaul van der Putten of the Netherlands Institute of International Relations. Japan has been competing with China in Asia, and that competition is expanding to other areas. Not everybody is convinced that Japan is playing a spoiler role against the Belt and Road, especially since Tokyo often makes ambiguous noises about welcoming Chinese investment that could benefit the region as a whole. Japan  if not India  even suggests periodically it could end up joining the Belt and Road at some point. Seen from Islamabad, the biggest beneficiary of the Belt and Road thanks to the 60 billion ChinaPakistan Economic Corridor CPEC, not even Japan and Indias partnership represents a serious threat. India and Japan can collaborate, but the Belt and Road is too big to be countered by them, and that is why they are keeping open the option to join sooner or later, said Ahmad Rashid Malik, the director of the ChinaPakistan Study Centre at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad. Foreign Minister Kono expressed interest in the CPEC when he made a rare trek to Islamabad last month, Malik said, while big economic actors such as the Japan External Trade Organization and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation have been bullish on more investments there. Japan is not opposing the CPEC. Ultimately, the bigger question is how sustainable Japans push for a leading role will prove  and if that will leave the door ajar for China after all. Abe wont be prime minister forever, and its not clear how deep his more muscular vision of Japans place in the world has penetrated the countrys political culture. More to the point, Japan  saddled with a sluggish economy, massive debt, and an aging and shrinking population  simply doesnt have the economic or diplomatic resources to replace the United States in Asia, Dujarric said. That could limit its role to a very valuable firebreak, until Washington sorts out whether it really wants to retreat or reengage with the world. If Trump is just a temporary ailment, Dujarric said, Japan can serve as a major BandAid until sanity returns to the U.S.

112 CHICAGO: 20 Inches Snow Forecast... Latest Chicago Snow Forecast: Total 13 To 17 Inches Over Weekend Possible February 8, 2018 at 2:14 pm UPDATE: Forecast improving. Now expect about 10 inches by Sunday. CHICAGO CBS  A total of up to 17 inches of snow could fall by the end of the weekend, a worstcase scenario that could put this event on par with some of the biggest in history. Starting tonight, snow will start falling and intensify overnight, with 6 to 12 inches of snow on the ground by noon. Some isolated areas may see 14 inches of snow on the ground. Schools and businesses were already announcing closings Heavy snow is expected to spread across northern Illinois early this evening, then continue into Friday. Travel tonight into Friday will likely be very difficult to impossible at times. Avoid any unnecessary travel. pic.twitter.comJqOCoUWpz5  NWS Chicago @NWSChicago February 8, 2018 Then, a second event will sweep into the area on Saturday, with one to three inches possible. If the storm dumps numbers in the higher range, the 17 inches would put it among the biggest ever. However, for recordkeeping purposes, the entire event might not be considered one single storm. The band of the heaviest snow is fairly narrow, so totals could vary. Heres a first look at the forecasted start time of the snow tonight. pic.twitter.comspVLhnadxE  NWS Chicago @NWSChicago February 8, 2018 With so much snow on the way, local and state road crews were planning for a very busy start to the weekend, in an effort to keep roads clear. The Illinois Department of Transportation maintains a fleet of 1,700 trucks used to plow and salt nearly 16,000 miles of Interstates and other state roads across Illinois when it snows. Last year, IDOT used more than 300,000 tons of salt. Meantime, the Chicago Department of Streets and Sanitation will deploy its full fleet of plows Thursday night. When it snows, the city starts by plowing and salting the citys main streets and Lake Shore Drive until the snow stops, then starts clearing side streets. We are going to be working all night to clear the streets, Mayor Emanuel said at a news conference on Thursday. Leave yourself time to get to work and get home. The mayor urged residents to check on sick and elderly neighbors to make sure they are safe. The city is ready for this, Emanuel said. This is a heavy snow, the heaviest we have seen in a couple of winters. Given that this storm is expected to last a full day, some side streets might not get plowed until Friday night.

Nuccio DiNuzzoChicago Tribune via AP Nuccio DiNuzzo Save CHICAGO AP  The shooting death of a police commander near a state government office building gripped parts of downtown Chicago as emergency workers tried to save the department veteran at the scene and officers shackled the suspect. Cmdr. Paul Bauer was shot multiple times Tuesday afternoon after he spotted a man matching the radio description of an armed suspect, the citys police superintendent said. Bauer saw the offender and engaged in an armed physical confrontation, Superintendent Eddie Johnson said. Officers had been chasing the man on foot. Bauer, 53, had been on the police force 31 years. Johnson choked back tears as he spoke to reporters outside Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where Bauer was pronounced dead. I just ask the citizens of this city to keep the Bauer family in their prayers, he said. A procession of law enforcement vehicles took Bauers body to the medical examiners office. Mayor Rahm Emanuel called Bauers death a tragic reminder of the dangerous duty the men and women of our police department accept to ensure the safety of us all. The shooting occurred near the James R. Thompson Center. Johnson said officers initially confronted the suspect because he was acting suspiciously. Police captured the man a short time later, and a gun was recovered at the scene, he said. It was initially reported that Bauer was offduty, but police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter late Tuesday that Bauer was onduty. He said in an email Wednesday that it was a chaotic scene and Bauer had been attending training at the Chicago Fire Department with other officials before the shooting. There was no communication from him on the radio informing dispatch that he was in pursuit of the offender or that he was even on scene, so they initially thought it was an offduty officer until someone recognized him, Guglielmi wrote. Some initial media reports said the suspected shooter may have been involved in the robbery of a local business, but Johnson did not provide details about what the man was doing that prompted officers to want to speak with him. Witnesses to parts of the incident said they heard gunshots. I was walking down the street and I heard pop pop pop pop pop, Noreen Danko, who was on her way to her office nearby, told the Chicago Tribune. And I said to the girl next to me, Is that what I think it is And she said, Yep. I said, Aw geez. And everybody is scurrying all over and I see the police head to the stairs there. Theres a stairwell there. And it goes downstairs. I heard that the door is locked there. It used to be a pedway, but now, for security reasons they have it locked. She told the newspaper that she saw officers lead the shackled suspect away and put him in a squad car, then watched as emergency workers administered CPR to Bauer, who was lying on a stretcher, before he was put inside an ambulance and rushed to the hospital.

126 Blackhawks end losing streak at eight with 71 victory against Capitals - Chicago Tribune Forget the One Goal mantra. The Blackhawks were desperate for one win Saturday night over the Capitals.They scored seven times, which ended losing streaks of eight overall and seven at home during a 71 victory.It took the Hawks 19 minutes,59.2 seconds to score three goals, something they hadnt done in their previous six games. That helped propel them to their first win in February and first at the United Center since Jan. 12.It certainly feels 100 times better than coming in and trying to explain how we had a lead and were unable to sustain it, Hawks coach Joel Quenneville said after his team topped two goals for just the fourth time in17 games and the first in the last seven.Jonathan Toews  why not shot 6:19 into the game accidentally made its way past Braden Holtby from the right side for Hawks first score. Toews second goal in 17 games put his team ahead 10, which has been dangerous territory for the Hawks.All they had to show for the last10 times they had scored first was a 262 record.Photos from the BlackhawksCapitals game at the United Center on Saturday, Feb. 17, 2018.First goal of the game was just throwing it on the net, at his feet from sharp angles, Toews said. Those go in once in a while. That was a nice way for us to start.A little more than six minutes and a tying goal from the Capitals Tom Wilson later, Brandon Saad socked away his second goal in two games after going 16 games without one. Seconds after Tommy Wingels  shot at an open net was deflected by Dmitry Orlov , Nick Schmaltz pasted one past Holtby with 0.8 seconds left in the period to make it 31.That kind of kicks teams when theyre down, Toews said of Schmaltzs goal.Not even Patrick Kane had been immune from the teams scoring allergies. He had just one goal in his last 13 games  a span in which the Hawks went 292  and none in his previous five going into Saturday.That changed when Kane deposited a rebound of Toews shot late in the second period to put the Hawks up 41. He later collected his 500th career assist on Artem Anisimov s goal in the second to become the eighth Americanborn player to reach that number as well as 300 goals.I dont think youre really thinking about numbers too much, Kane said. When you cross certain numbers, its always a pretty cool feeling. If you play long enough and you play with good enough players, those things are inevitable.For good measure, Ryan Hartman added his first goal since Dec. 29 near the end of the second period. Anisimov netted his second in 19 games to give the Hawks three goals in a 2:07 span.Alex DeBrincat made it 71 in the third with his 22nd of the season. He retreated to the locker room shortly after he was hit by Wilson, who received a 10minute misconduct penalty, with just under four minutes left.Quenneville said DeBrincat was fine.The mood of the Hawks, who received a standing ovation from the seasonhigh crowd of 22,066, was finer.Lets see how we respond to this because theres a lot of hockey left, Quenneville said.pskrbina@chicagotribune.comTwitter @ChiTribSkrbinaPaul Skrbinas three stars1.

133 Northwest suburbs work to clear roads as snow continues to fall - Chicago Tribune Although area snowfall totals have fallen short of initial weather forecasts that predicted as much as 14 inches of snow by Friday morning, public works crews in Arlington Heights have been able to keep local streets plowed and salted partly thanks to schools cancelling classes, said Scott Shirley, public works director for Arlington Heights.By early Friday morning, the village had seen about six inches of snow, but the total is expected to grow, Shirley said.Light snow has been forecasted to fall intermittently throughout the day with one to three inches expected by Friday night and an additional one to three inches expected by Sunday morning.This snowfall seems to have scooted south, and they keep changing the forecast, so theres a lot of guesswork involved, Shirley said. But were feeling lucky today because all of the local schools are closed, which in our minds is a good thing, as it takes a lot of the traffic off the roads, and we dont have kids on the sidewalks walking to school.Stacey Wescott  Chicago Tribune Ben Brown uses a snow blower to clear his parents driveway in Barrington on Feb. 9, 2018. Ben Brown uses a snow blower to clear his parents driveway in Barrington on Feb. 9, 2018. Stacey Wescott  Chicago Tribune With weather forecasts calling for more than a foot of snow by Friday morning, most northwest suburban public and private schools decided to close Friday, including Arlington Heights School District 25, Township High School District 214, Barrington School District 220, KildeerCountryside School District 96, Lake Zurich School District 95, LincolnshirePrairie View School District 103 and Stevenson High School.District 220 Superintendent Brian Harris said he huddled with other northwest suburban administrators, including Township High School District 214 Superintendent David Schuler, during a phone conference late Thursday afternoon, leading to a clear cut decision to close schools.Everyone thought it was a good idea to close, but each district has so many variants leading up to that decision, Harris said. We got about eight inches of snow in Barrington, which is pretty significant  and its still snowing Friday.Generally, the decision to cancel classes at District 220s 12 schools largely depends on whether students safety will be at risk during inclement weather.We have 72 square miles of road in the district, and busing is a big part of our student transportation, Harris said. We also have a lot of rural, onelane roads in Barrington Hills and North Barrington, which makes driving in the snow very challenging.Stacey Wescott  Chicago Tribune Natasha Janota, 6, of Barrington, plays in a mound of snow outside of her home in Barrington on Feb. 9, 2018. Natasha Janota, 6, of Barrington, plays in a mound of snow outside of her home in Barrington on Feb. 9, 2018. Stacey Wescott  Chicago Tribune While Arlington Heights only had around six inches of snow by Friday morning, District 25 Superintendent Lori Bein said officials were confident that closing schools was definitely the right call.Bein said she also joined in a group phone call with nearby administrators from District 214 and other area elementary schools Thursday afternoon.The consensus from the meeting was crews would not have enough time in the morning to clear the roads and allow for safe passage of school buses, as well as parents who drive their children to school, since the bulk of the snowfall was expected to arrive overnight.Its a light, soft snow, but its a significant amount, and theres more on the way, Bein said. Well just have to see what Mother Nature has in store.While some parents might see the snow day as the perfect opportunity for kids to catch up on their school work, Bein suggested that families also try to enjoy the unexpected day together at home.I think its great if families can get outside and play in the snow, and then come inside to warm up and read a good story together, or watch a family movie, Bein said.Even though area students received the day off Friday, the public works department in Arlington Heights dispatched 32 employees, who started working 12hour shifts once the snowstorm started, to plow and salt local streets, Shirley said.If the predicted snowfall for late Friday and the weekend is accurate, Shirley said, Arlington Heights would be already on par with last year, with another three to six weeks of winter weather to go.We have a lot of tools in our toolbox to deal with snow, but Mother Nature can always undo our efforts, he said.In nearby Buffalo Grove, where scores of children were out in the neighborhoods Friday afternoon enjoying the more than six inches of powdery snow, public works crews cleared roads and kept a watchful eye out for youngsters playing near the street, officials said.When the crews are out plowing in the community, theyre always keeping their eyeballs on a swivel to look our for all of the kids because the biggest piles of snow are near the street, and unfortunately, thats where the kids want to build their snow forts, said Buffalo Grove Maintenance Supervisor Bryan Beitzel.Despite the slow start to the winter season, the frequent snow flurries during the past two weeks have been keeping village crews busy lately, he said.We try to stay on a consistent schedule with the same crew 12 hours on and 12 hours off because its important that the guys have a consistent sleep schedule and sufficient downtime between shifts, Beitzel said.kcullotta@tribpub.comTwitter @kcullotta High Schools Arlington Heights Barrington
134 MBB: College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin Quote: from: Titan Q on Today at 05:19:43 pm Quote: from: Gregory Sager on Today at 04:03:32 pmWhat bothered me about how the officials responded was that they disregarded his obvious intent. Its one thing to commit a hard foul, and its another thing altogether to knock a player to the floor and then stand over him for several seconds, glaring down at him with a macho, Yeah, Ive just put you on your ass. Whaddya gonna do about it look. The officials didnt respond to that at all, which disappointed me because it not only left open the potential for that provocation to turn into something worse, it also revealed the intent behind the foul itself. They didnt even come over right away to intervene my initial worry was that this incident would bring somebody off of the NPU bench, as it took place right in front of that part of the sideline they waited until Jason Hines had walked over and brushed past Knobloch as a bodyguard gesture before they scrambled over towards the NPU bench and separated the players. Given that context, the intent behind the hard foul by Knobloch on Lake under the west basket after Josh Washburns steal at about the 5:00 mark of the second half shouldve been obvious.Just watched that play. Starts at about 30:25...https:boxcast.tvviewmbbilwesleyanatnorthpark895503Didnt Lake kick Knobloch Isnt that what Knobloch stared at him for Instead of Yeah, Ive just put you on your ass. Whaddya gonna do about it wasnt it more Why TF did you just kick meYou 100 sure you are describing this accuratelyfairlyI cant believe that was the play we have had pedantic conversation about.Two kids were a little heated during a game, bumped each other and gave each other the look. Knoblach didnt even stand over him. He walked around him and got away immediately, while giving him the look. So what, they are competitors. This isnt Goon Ball in my eyes. If it happened more frequently maybe I would be worried. Reading the Quote: s it sounds like their is no bad blood between the two players, they moved on...

The Chicago Department of Public Health said Monday that according to its Healthy Chicago report 6 percent of Chicago high school students reported smoking cigarettes in 2017. That number was 13.6 percent in 2011. About 7 percent of teens reported using cigars, 4.5 percent said they used smokeless tobacco and 6.6 percent reported electronic cigarette use. Health officials say serious health consequences are possible if young people use tobacco in any form. The report found a decline in use of cigarettes and electronic cigarettes among those ages 18 to 20. The number dropped from 15.2 percent in 2015 to 9.7 percent in 2016. The reductions come after Chicago passed a law raising the age for purchasing tobacco to 21 from 18. TAGS

WAND  Rough weather created some hurdles for a Valentines Daythemed fundraiser. The part of the Valentines Day Fun Run that dealt with actual running had to be canceled because of ice and the slick surface it caused on Decatur sidewalks. While that setback kept everyone inside, it didnt stop the annual pancake breakfast from happening. The run usually includes 1 and 3 mile trips. I woke up and got up early and was like Oh, they canceled the run, said an unnamed person involved in the Fun Run. But we still got to eat and help out and meet some new people. Sundays events still included special store hours at organizer Fleet Feet Sports from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. They, along with Ray Eldridge Jewelry, gave out raffle prizes to people who came. Donations and money from raffle ticket sales went to the track program at Millikin University. Organizers say one of the main goals of the Fun Run was to help people stay in shape.

156 Legionella ‘Possibly’ Found in Illinois Capitol Complex Legionella Possibly Found in Illinois Capitol Complex Published at 10:20 PM CST on Jan 22, 2018 Receive the latest local updates in your inbox Email Privacy policy  More Newsletters Legionella bacteria was possibly found in the Capitol Complex hot water system, an official from the Illinois Secretary of States office said Monday. The bacteria can cause Legionnaires disease but Mike Wojcik, director of physical services for the Secretary of States office, said the department was not aware of any reports of the disease among state employees or the general public. Out of an abundance of caution and because of heightened awareness and continued misconceptions about Legionnaires disease, we want to make you aware of preliminary test results that indicate the possible presence of Legionella bacteria in the Capitol Complex hot water system, Wojcik said in a memo to all Capitol Complex state employees obtained by NBC 5. Wojcik said more testing was underway and results should be available in two weeks. In the meantime, we have been advised by experts that the transmission of this bacteria in normal, daytoday office operations is unlikely, he said in the memo. Legionnaires disease is usually contracted by inhaling mist or vapor from a contaminated water source, he said. It is not contracted through drinking water or from another person. Employees were advised to not using showers in the complex and aerators were to be removed, Wojcik said. More information on a Legionella can be found here.

164 Chicago residents wonder if a root canal dental treatment is worth it   Chicago residents wonder if a root canal dental treatment is worth it Chicago residents wonder if a root canal dental treatment is worth it   Tooth sensitivity or tenderness is a sign of a problem and needs to be addressed. This may stem from decay or trauma. Root canal dental treatment may be a solution to preserve the health of your mouth. Unfortunately, the term root canal has a bad reputation that has many patients wondering if the treatment is worth it. Throw away the misconceptions. Located in Chicago, IL , the team at Big Smile Dental is here to disprove the bad reputation and make patients aware of the health benefits of root canal treatments. Root canals are not scary. The thought of having a root canal has many patients cringing because they fear the treatment, and believe the negativity surrounding it. Forget everything you thought to be true. A root canal is not intimidating. The treatment is performed to remove the damaged or infected dental pulp. This saves the tooth and preserves the health of the oral cavity. The procedure is as routine as having a cavity treated, and it does not cause pain. Damage or decay present in a tooth can lead to infection or inflammation. This may cause sensitivity or tenderness. Visible facial swelling is possible if the patient has an abscessed tooth. It is important to seek dental help if you experience any of these symptoms. Even if the symptoms subside, the underlying infection will not clear up on its own. Dental care is needed. What is a root canal When determining if the treatment is right for you, first get rid of your preconceived, negative ideas about root canal treatment. The goal is to relieve your pain and save your tooth. When bacteria and infection have spread throughout a tooth, the pulp inside the tooth is damaged. Without treatment, the tooth may become so damaged that it cannot be saved. When the infection is caught, a root canal is often recommended to preserve the natural tooth, thus protecting the health of your mouth. Your dentists goal is to preserve as much of your natural tooth as possible. When a root canal is performed, bacteria and affected tissue are removed, and the canal is sterilized. The tooth is saved. Using a gentle, trained touch, the entire procedure is routine and comfortable. Root canal dental treatment preserves your tooth, with long lasting health benefits. Once you have forgotten your negative thoughts about root canals, you can see the benefits of this therapy are numerous. Key points to remember about root canal therapy include: The treatment is not painful. Neither the tooth nor the root is removed. The natural tooth is saved. A root canal rids the tooth of bacteria. The effects of the treatment are long lasting with proper oral health care.   If a root canal has been suggested, it is likely that you are already experiencing sensitivity due to infection or inflammation. A root canal is a routine, everyday procedure. It is as simple as having a cavity treated. The treatment relieves the tenderness and protects your oral health. Your dentist uses xrays to show the location and depth of the damage. The damaged section is removed before the tooth is disinfected and filled. The process relieves the pressure. Your symptoms subside as the tooth heals. Your dentist strives to protect your oral health. This includes the teeth, gums, and underlying structures. The point of a root canal is to save your tooth. The roots remain in place. This keeps your jawbone healthy and prevents the surrounding teeth from shifting. During the procedure, infected material is removed to ensure the remaining bacteria are eliminated. Since the bacteria is safely removed, no infection remains to make the patient ill. Your oral and overall health are improved with a root canal dental treatment. The entire procedure is safe and effective. Once the tooth has been treated, a crown is placed on top for added protection. This preserves the health of the tooth. By following good oral practices and regular dental visits, the results of your treatment are long lasting. Dont let fear stand in the way of your beautiful smile.

166 Meet American figure skater Vincent Zhou, who has been largely overshadowed by Adam Rippon and Nathan Chen - Chicago Tribune The personality of American figure skater Vincent Zhou, who made his Olympic debut with a superb short program Friday, was neatly summed up by his social media response to a fan who recently asked what era he would visit if he could travel back in time.If I time traveled, he said, I would likely end up in outer space because Earth is moving at 67,000 mph and time travel is only time travel and not spacetime travel. If you traveled back in time 1 seconds, youd be about 1,116.667 miles into space away from the surface of Earth where you were just standing. To successfully end up on Earth after time travel, science would have to find a way to make up those miles. Teleportation of matter is not possible. Yet.Clearly, this isnt your average 17yearold kid.But to answer the original question, Zhou continued in another Tweet, I would go back to 1984 to fully experience the release of Take On Me by aha.So hes not just smart, hes funny.Not just brilliant but bemusing.Part of it is from all Ive gone through, he explained. Ive gained a pretty good perspective on the world, and that helps me make appropriate and witty remarks.Despite that, Zhou has been largely overshadowed by his teammates during the Pyeongchang Olympics.The openly gay Adam Rippon has become a media darling, combining excellent skating to help the U.S. win team bronze with an unfiltered approach to interviews. The talented Nathan Chen had been tipped as a gold medal favorite until everything went awry during his short program.Together, they had held the spotlight until Zhou landed the first quad lutz in an Olympic event, and put together the best short program of his career to briefly take the lead.He wound up 12th among 30 skaters, easily qualifying for Saturdays free skate.Im happy that I committed to my jumps and Im happy that I gave it my all, Zhou said.Make no mistake, Zhou is trying to finish as high as possible during these Olympics, and a top10 result is hardly out of reach. But he also knows the next Olympics could be more his time, the moment when everything aligns and he contends for a medal.That doesnt seem so far away considering how far Zhou has already come.You see, Zhous parents emigrated from China in the early 1990s, settling in California to attend graduate school. Both became successful computer scientists in Silicon Valley, Zhous father with Google  where he still works  and his mother as a groundbreaking programmer with Oracle.It was after they had Zhou and his older sister, Vivian, that their precocious boy took an interest in figure skating. And with no toplevel coaching available in the Bay Area, the family decided that his mom, Fei Ge, would move with Zhou to Southern California in pursuit of his dream.Things became tight with only one income. Living apart from the other half of the family was tough.Zhous mother admits she thought Zhou would take figure skating to a certain level and grow tired of it, and the separation would be a shortterm arrangement. But he wound up excelling, and they would continue living and training in Southern California before moving to Colorado years later.Meanwhile, his sister became an accomplished diver, and shes now pursuing a degree in brain and cognitive science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.My family has sacrificed absolutely everything for me, Zhou said, halfjoking that his figure skating career has made him the oddball in a family of brilliant scientists. I think thats given me more maturity than a lot of kids my age.Not that Zhou isnt smart. He graduated from high school at 16.Lots of kids his age arent pondering the scientific problems of time travel, either.The reality is Zhou has little interest in what most kids his age do. He would rather spend his time writing poetry or deep in thought, or on the practice ice trying to perfect his array of quadruple jumps.A lot of the pressure in skating does come from the outside, he said. There are fans who want to give you a standing ovation after skating a clean performance, there are people who expect you to improve and be a complete skater. Theres pressure coming from all sides. But the biggest source of pressure is from myself. Sometimes I dont show it on the outside, but Im a really ambitious person.That was evident in his quadfilled short program at the Pyeongchang Games.I always want to be the best, but I also do have a sense of realism, he said, and I know that winning the Olympics isnt really realistic. So its fortunate I dont have that pressure on myself. I cant imagine what its like for the people vying for the title. But I definitely want to put out two great performances and show people what Im capable of.It sounds cheesy, he added, but its true.American Vincent Zhou becomes first figure skater to land a quad lutz in the Olympics Japans Yuzuru Hanyu sets Olympic record in short program 2018 Winter Olympics: TV schedule and highlights Maggie Voisins final run not enough to capture slopestyle medal Nathan Chen dazzles after poor short program, finishes 5th overall Yuzuru Hanyu defends gold medal For Olympians in the quadrennial spotlight, social media can be an extreme sport Privacy Policy Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Figure Skating 2018 Winter Olympics
167 Gov. Bruce Rauner: Economic growth is in Illinois’ DNA http:ift.tt2nsTzZ5  Illinois boasts a brilliant legacy. It has 200 years of extraordinary accomplishments in its asset base and sets us up for an opportunity to build a truly remarkable future.It will take an uncommon level of collaboration to succeed but, as we have seen, big numbers can create a stampede of unity. Amazon brought together virtually every dissident faction in Illinois to construct a bid for a 15year, 168,000job project.The State of Illinois project is potentially just as lucrative. There is no question that we have what it takes to win the bid. The question is whether we have the will to put politics aside and roll up our sleeves to produce more jobs and better lives for the people of Illinois.Were ready for the challenge. The state has made remarkable strides in education. Weve transformed the funding formula and created funding parity for charter schools.People have already donated 45 million to our Invest in Kids tax credit scholarship program. The contributions will make it possible for children of lowerincome families to get into schools that meet their needs.The point is, we are taking the steps necessary to prepare our children to participate and prosper in the 21st century workforce.Our criminal justice reforms are aimed at joboriented outcomes, too. To be sure, there is simply no better crime deterrent than a goodpaying job. Were helping nonviolent, young offenders prepare for work after prison. The private sector is helping former offenders with apprenticeships and entrepreneur training.Along with a focus on jobs, we have been improving service to taxpayers. Weve cut fees for small business and our agencies have scissored through mountains of red tape. The idea is to get government out of the way so businesses can go to battle in the marketplace rather than fight city hall.Our tech initiatives are also helping us transform health delivery services and save us millions through Medicaid fraud detection and prevention. The dollars we are investing in these systems are paying off in greater efficiency and much better customer service. In fact, our technology initiatives are hastening response times and saving taxpayers millions of dollars.The seeds of growth have been planted. Well need the nurturing skills of one of our 72,000 farms to harvest the benefits. The heavy lifting will come when pension reform and taxes are on the agenda.The good news is we agree that pensions are out of control. They are bankrupting the state, and their unfunded liabilities are so high that retiree benefits are jeopardized. Most agree that we cannot sustain massive levels of pension spending.Many of us also agree that we cant tax our way out of trouble. Been there. Done that. Doesnt work. Property taxes, in particular, are pushing people out of house and home  and state. Time to stop sending our best people to Indiana and Wisconsin.This legislative session we need to overcome the politics and unite behind a jobs agenda. I am confident we can do it. It is in our DNA.Throughout its history, Illinois has been a magnet. If you wanted to till the soil, lay a brick, build a building, make a deal, supercompute, you name it  you could find work in Illinois, afford a home, and rely on the public schools to educate your children.In this Bicentennial year, we have an opportunity to turn yesterday into tomorrow, and make Illinois the powerhouse job creator it should be.Weve started the job. Today well be asking the people of Illinois and the legislature to help us finish it.Bruce Rauner is the governor of Illinois. He is scheduled to give his State of the State address at noon Wednesday.  
168 Agudath Israel of Illinois Lauds Bi-Partisan Solution to Scholarship Tax Credit Program Impasse On Friday, January 26, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner announced the adoption of a policy to include previously excluded schools in Illinois new tax credit scholarship program, the Invest in Kids Act. The breakthrough came after the Rauner administration, a bipartisan group of lawmakers, the Illinois State Board of Education ISBE, the Illinois Department of Revenue IDOR, and advocates including Agudath Israel of Illinois worked together to find an expedient way to include as many of these schools as possible without compromising the integrity of the program.The Invest in Kids Act was part of an historic bipartisan school funding bill signed in 2017 which included a 100 million scholarship tax credit program for low and middleincome families. Unfortunately, a provision in the law that requires schools to be recognized by ISBE, prevented 257 registered schools, many of which cater to disadvantaged children, from participating in the program. Since the most recent official list of recognized schools is from 2016, this provision excluded schools that applied for recognition but have not yet been approved, and even schools that are currently recognized, but not on ISBEs 2016 list. As a result, students who wished to attend highquality schools, including some Jewish schools, were not eligible to receive scholarships.After weeks of discussions between the aforementioned parties including Agudath Israel of Illinois AIOI, ISBE generated a new updated list of recognized schools that include all schools that were recognized in 2017 and allowed schools that have a recognition visit scheduled to provisionally participate pending the outcome of ISBEs visit.In a statement released by the Governors office, advocates, including AIOI, were acknowledged and Quote: d. Following discussions with stakeholders, a solution ensuring the participation of all schools that become recognized was achieved, said Rabbi Shlomo Soroka, AIOIs director of government affairs. Agudath Israel of Illinois thanks the Rauner Administration, the bipartisan group of legislators, the Illinois State Board of Education, the Illinois Department of Revenue, and advocates, who worked together to provide quality educational options to more students.

The company behind the cheesy chips said Tuesday that its not developing a line of Doritos designed specifically for women, despite widespread online speculation that it was.The phrase lady Doritos trended on social media after PepsiCos longtime CEO Indra Nooyi said on a podcast that unlike men, women dont like to lick their fingers after eating a bag of Doritos.Women would love to do the same, but they dont, Nooyi said in an interview on the Freakonomics podcast. They dont like to crunch too loudly in public. And they dont lick their fingers generously and they dont like to pour the little broken pieces and the flavor into their mouth.Nooyi, who has run the soda and snack company for more than a decade, later said the company is getting ready to launch snacks that are designed and packaged differently for women. Women love to carry a snack in their purse, Nooyi said.But PepsiCo said the interpretation of her comments to mean that femalefriendly Doritos were in the works were inaccurate.We already have Doritos for women  theyre called Doritos, the company said in a statement Tuesday.

He sees a lot of similar traits between himself and the 39yearold Nagy, whom he holds in high regard.Hes a great coach, the 32yearold McVay said of Nagy. Just watching his offense, especially the way he called those last six games, and then the offenses hes been a part of in Kansas City, really impressive. I know some people on that Chicago staff that have been really impressed with just what hes done already getting into that building. Very excited for coach Nagy.Despite his limited experience, McVay was hired at the age of 30 as the youngest coach in NFL history. He was the Redskins assistant tight ends coach in 2010 and led that group beginning in 2011. In 2014, McVay became the teams offensive coordinator, spending three years establishing Kirk Cousins as a starting quarterback.Ultimately, the Rams were drawn to McVay because of his extensive plans to develop young quarterback Jared Goff, the top pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. Goff was named Most Improved Player by the Professional Football Writers Association after his first season with McVay.The Bears are hoping that Nagy can develop Mitchell Trubisky, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, into a franchise quarterback like the Rams seem to have.Jareds always had a lot of confidence, McVay said. I know the rookie year didnt go the way we wanted it to go. But when you watch the way he responded, you never sensed he lost any confidence. He stayed the course, he got around some people where he could worry about what can he control, and thats the fundamentals, the techniques of the position, consistently delivering the ball with accuracy, and then just being himself.You knew why he was a No. 1 overall pick. I think you see a lot of the same things in Mitchell, why observers are excited about the future with him.In 2017, the Rams won the NFC West and finished 115, a year after going 412 and firing veteran coach Jeff Fisher. They had talented pieces on the roster under Fishers watch but couldnt put it all together, and the trouble started at the quarterback position with Goff.A major part of the success McVay enjoyed with the Rams last season came thanks to a strong coaching staff he built upon being hired. McVay looked to balance out his deficiencies as a young coach with the right supporting cast, including the respected Wade Phillips as defensive coordinator. He also retained John Fassel as special teams coordinator, overseeing the leagues best unit.Nagy constructed a wellrounded coaching staff that included retaining Vic Fangio as defensive coordinator, hiring former Oregon head coach Mark Helfrich as offensive coordinator and tabbing Chris Tabor to lead the special teams. He also landed an important hire in Harry Hiestand as offensive line coach.On several occasions, Nagy has stated that he will be leaning on the experience of his assistants.Its all about your coaching staff to start out, McVay said. We were able to build a mix of good veteran leadership and also some younger coaches that Ive gotten exposure to that are going to get an opportunity to run their own rooms and things like that. I think we had a good balance of veteran leadership with also some young players that are excited about positively pushing each other. Thats what we got on our coaching staff, and Im sure Nagy will do the same thing.The rookie season for McVay will be heralded for some time because his hiring by the Rams was considered surprising. It was the first head coaching interview he had received, and the natural thought was that he couldnt handle that role at such a young age.Instead, McVay led the Rams to new heights during his first year on the job and helped Goff establish himself with the potential hoped. The team eventually bowed out during the wildcard round and ended its revival with the disappointment that accompanies so many teams seasons.While McVay was crowned as the games best coach this past season, he remained grounded the whole time. Its why he believes in Nagys future with the Bears.You learn that you dont know everything, McVay said. Its always a consistent approach of trying to get better, listening and learning from everybody else, and then that will help you become a better leader. Its all about the people, and we got great people around.Chris Emma covers the Bears, Chicagos sports scene and more for 670 The Score 670TheScore.com.

Report: Derrick Rose Earning 11 Million From Adidas This Season Posted: 06 Feb 2018 09:45 AM PST670 The Score Despite little oncourt production, Derrick Rose is earning 11 million from Adidas this basketball season as part of the endorsement deal he signed with them back in 2012, Sports Illustrated reported .Rose signed a reported 14year, 185million deal with Adidas in February 2012, less than a year after he led the Bulls to the Eastern Conference finals and became the youngest MVP in NBA history at age 22. Rose received 12 million annually through the 201617 season, Sports Illustrated reported, in addition to annual royalties up to 6.25 million and annual appearance fees up to 4.8 million.Additionally, Roses brother Reggie, is is paid between 250,000 and 300,000 annually to serve as a consultant for Adidas, Sports Illustrated reported.Rose, 29, has played just 14 games this season, averaging 11.0 points per game, as hes once again dealt with injury problems, which first starkly surfaced when he tore his left ACL in the playoffs in April 2012. Rose has had four knee surgeries in all since that fateful moment that changed the trajectory of his career. Rose took a leave of absence from the Cavaliers in late November as he contemplated retirement, according to reports.Many endorsement contracts for professional athletes can include financial reduction language that provides protections for companies if the said athlete isnt healthy enough to play or if they dont perform to a certain level, but Roses contract included nullifying clauses for that so long as he made certain promotional appearances, Sports Illustrated reported.Former DNAinfo Chicago Staffers To Launch New Local News Site Posted: 06 Feb 2018 09:43 AM PSTCHICAGO CBS  Three months after the popular DNAinfo Chicago website was shut down, some of its former editors and staffers have teamed up to start a new subscriptionbased site to resume their focus on hyperlocal news.Editor in Chief Shamus Toomey and two other editors expect to launch Block Club Chicago in April, and already have reached their initial fundraising goal of 25,000. DNAinfo focused on extensive neighborhood news coverage not provided by larger news outlets from new restaurants and other businesses opening to crime, and from local school council issues to real estate developments.People like you let us know when we closed down that they felt value out of what we were doing. They missed us, Toomey said on the CBS 2 News at 11. We were providing sort of that neighborhood coverage that sometimes its harder to get from bigger stations, because well go to the community meetings, well go to the CAPS meetings, the Park District meetings in the neighborhoods. So the little stuff where some great news comes out.Block Club Chicago also has received startup funds from Civil, a blockchainbased platform supporting hyperlocal news operations across the U.S. Block Club Chicago plans to charge approximately 5 per month for subscriptions, and will run as a nonprofit.Along with Toomey, the operation will be led by fellow former DNAinfo editors Jen Sabella and Stephanie Lulay. It will be staffed by former DNAinfo reporters Kelly Bauer, Mauricio Pea, Alisa Hauser, and Mina Bloom former Chicago Defender and Chicago Crusader reporter Lee Edwards and a network of freelancers.Our reporters were really the lifeblood of the organization. They were night and day just really looking for a new story, Toomey said. So we decided maybe this is too good to just let go.Toomey acknowledged Block Club Chicago will be a bit smaller than DNAinfo at the beginning, but he hopes community support will help them quickly expand.Aldermen OK Outside Investigation Into Des Plaines Police Golf Outing Posted: 06 Feb 2018 09:18 AM PSTCHICAGO WBBM NEWSRADIO  Aldermen in Des Plaines have voted to spend up to 50,000 for an independent investigator to look into allegations of criminal misconduct during a police golf outing.This now makes three investigations into what occurred during the outing in Hoffman Estates last June. Police are conducting what theyre calling a criminal investigation.The investigations are looking into allegations of sexual assault involving an alleged female victim, who was then a police officer, at a party following the offduty golf outing.Ald. Malcolm Chester is among the city council members who sponsored the proposal about hiring an investigative firm. He says an outside firm is necessary because Hoffman Estates police are seeking evidence that could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas an internal probe may suggest corrective action or provide evidence in a lawsuit.Its my hope that the facts will come forward and we will find out a lot of these allegations prove not to be correct and that our police force acted appropriately, Chester said. Im hoping what well really see at the end of this is some sunshine.Des Plaines Police Chief Bill Kushner says there will also be an internal investigation.As Market Stagnates, Scott Boras Believes Abundance Of Rebuilding Teams Is A Cancer To Baseball Posted: 06 Feb 2018 09:09 AM PSTNEW YORK AP  Agent Scott Boras says the number of major league teams rebuilding with younger, lowercost rosters has become a cancer to the sport, attributing behavior to the strengthened luxury tax combining with restraints on draftpick salaries.Boras attributes baseballs attendance drop to an increase in noncompetitive teams, predicts fans from perennial losers will increasingly stay away from ballparks until ticket prices are cut and says regional sports networks will negotiate lower rights fees with teams going into rebuild cycles.J.D. Martinez, Mike Moustakas, Eric Hosmer and Jake Arrieta, all Boras clients, remain unsigned 10 days before spring training in a historically slow market. He says the luxury tax, envisioned by Commissioner Bud Selig to increase competitive balance, is having the opposite effect. He claims incentives are needed to winning, such as increasing draftpick money based on victories.They decided were going to have the 12 teamsatanking, if you will, and therefore youre got a noncompetitive cancer and this is completely opposite of what commissioner Selig in goodfaith sought in bargaining, Boras said Monday.Competitors watched a pair of successful rebuilds in the past two seasons. The Chicago Cubs won the 2016 World Series four years after losing 101 games and Houston took last years title four years after losing 111.Since 2012, baseballs collective bargaining agreement has limited the amount teams can spend on signing bonuses for amateur draft picks, making their cost predictable. Teams draft in reverse order of record, and clubs with higher selections are given larger amounts in their signingbonus pools.There is a number of teams, lets call it 10 or 12 in baseball, that are tearing down and rebuilding, Seattle general manager Jerry Dipoto said during the Mariners prespring training media availability on Jan. 25. You could argue that youre going to compete with more clubs to try to get the first pick in the draft than you would to win the World Series.Agent Brodie Van Wagenen suggested Friday that players consider boycotting spring training workouts, which start Feb. 14 but are not mandatory until Feb. 24. Dodgers closer Kenley Janson told Los Angeles reporters at the teams FanFest on Jan. 27 that maybe we have to go on strike, to be honest with you.Baseball has had labor peace since a 7 12month strike that caused the cancellation of the 1994 World Series. Under the labor contract covering 201721, the highest luxury tax rate was raised from 50 percent to 95 percent and penalties were added that could push back a highspending teams top draft pick or cause a loss of selections.The New York Yankees are intent of getting under the tax threshold for the first time after paying 341 million since the tax started in 2003. The Los Angeles Dodgers, who have led the major leagues in spending for the last four years, also are on track to get under this years 197 million threshold for what is formally known as the competitive balance tax.The restraint on the CBT grew, grew dramatically different than what was intended initially, Boras said. The intent was to create competition. The way the system is operating now, it is dramatically doing just the opposite. It is in affect creating competitive restraints where a third of the league is no longer competitive.Boras questioned why fans would want to pay the same price to attend games involving noncompetitive teams as they would to watch clubs trying to win.Where you have two tanking teams or one tanking team is in town to play a good team, theyre going to demand a reduction because the true MLB experience is no longer what it was professed to be, he said.Major league games averaged 30,042 fans last year, down 0.4 percent from 2016 and the lowest average since 2003.RSNs are going to start putting dynamics in their contracts, Boras said. You may see lawsuits where the RSNs are saying you in good faith promised us competitive performances. Youre not delivering that. Youre tanking. The audience knows youre not trying win.One of his solutions is to add money to a teams draft pool based on its wins and to punish teams with poorer records.If you win 78 games you get 2 million more in the draft, or if you win 80 games you get 4 or 6 or 8 or 10 as you go up the scale and you get 10 million in draft money if you wins 86 games, he said. You dont win more than 68 games, you dont get a topfive draft pick. And thats what every team is coveting to get, so they have a reason where they go, whoa, we cannot be that bad. We have to be that good.Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. Baffoe: Now What, Chicago Sports Fans Posted: 06 Feb 2018 08:56 AM PSTBy Tim Baffoe 670 The Score Has the anxiety that comes with a hangover set in yet Following a fantastic Super Bowl that saw the Philadelphia Eagles improbably outlast the New Patriots for the formers first title in franchise history, we here in Chicago are now left exhaling. And looking around us. And asking, Now what And becoming suddenly worried about the possible answers. One week from today, pitchers and catchers for the Cubs and White Sox report, the other side of the demarcation of the meteorological sports year that ends with the last NFL game. The TV shots of relievers stretching gives us a pleasant saccharine taste of warmer things to come and a conscious, fleeting attempt to force spring forward. But midFebruary is just a tease that real baseball is further away. The continuation of the established Cubs and the building White Sox cant yet fill the void we have here, even if regularseason games do start in late March.This sinking feeling of having so little Chicago sportswise to enjoy for now is very temporary and more a figment of the mind than anything dire, but it doesnt make it any less uncomfortable. The Super Bowl highlighted for us the conundrum that is the Chicago Bears, a team that may be trending upward, but who the hell really knows Sure, the announcement Saturday that former Bears middle linebacker Brian Urlacher had been elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame felt great and validating and fitting the franchises positional stereotype of George and Butkus and Singletary. If history says that, I guess Im a part of that category now, Urlacher said . Its a great honor to be associated with the Hall of Fame and now to be in it. Its awesome. This experience has been very cool for me. Very humbling.So cool. But the Bears of today are still in flux. Will Mitchell Trubisky become anything like Nick Foles or Carson Wentz have been for the Eagles Is new 39yearold head coach Matt Nagy the next sideline phenom or another in a streak of badtouninspiring that weve dealt with for the better part of three decadesAndy Reid told me that Matt Nagy is the best headcoaching candidate hes ever had, NFL.coms Adam Caplan podcast in November . He told me that at the owners meetings. I just happened to ask him who some candidates are on his roster of coaches and he loves Matt Nagy, who he had in Philly.Thats a great endorsement when you consider Nagy joins five other of Reids assistants as current head coaches in the NFL and will have former head coach Brad Childress help, as the Bears hired him as an offensive consultant Monday . But is the current state of the Bears following the psycheandsoul drainings of the Trestman and Fox eras the stuff of the glasses half fullThe NFL draft is months away and the next Bears game much more distant, though. In the meantime, there are the Blackhawks and Bulls, if youre into that. The championship window on the ice closed fast and hard this season, with the Blackhawks as of Monday holding a mere 15 percent chance of making the Stanley Cup playoffs . This is a team that had the most points in the Western Conference last season.We still got a lot of time left, coach Joel Quenneville said over the weekend . But I dont think you want to look any further than one game and trying to capture some momentum. Trying to get some consistency for a 60minute game, that, to me would be some nice momentum.Not exactly inspiring. Goalie Corey Crawford, who last played in a game on Dec. 23, was back on the ice working out the past three days, which gives a glimmer of hope of salvaging the season, but his return to gameplay is, well, as clear as any NHL injury update.Thatd be optimistic, days, Quenneville said of how far away Crawford is from wearing a game sweater. And when I say days, the fact hes on the ice, I dont think itll be too far away, once hes practicing with us, that hed be able to play. The Bulls are  entertaining But Nikola Mirotic is now traded, and others may follow between now and Thursdays trade deadline. The players best effort to defy the tank has proved futile, as theyve lost seven in a row, including to the otherwisetankingharder Sacramento Kings in a spectacular battle of the tanking wills Monday night.The Bulls have the leagues sixthworst record, but they have the moxie to sink lower and are only two games out of the leagues bottom spot. That whole Hey, the Bulls are overachieving scare has gone away thankfully, and draft lottery thoughts become a big ol warm afghan for the time being.So it seems we have a few months of whatifs across the Chicago sports board to fill the now what until baseball. It feels icky in the stomach, but at least it doesnt last.Tim Baffoe is a columnist for 670TheScore.com. Follow Tim on Twitter @TimBaffoe .

Researchers are now hoping their experiments lead to a vaccine for human cancer patients.The new treatment, which was directly injected into the tumor sites of 90 mice, cured 87 mice of the disease. Stanfords formula contains two immunestimulating agents which were so effective they eliminated the tumors they were injected into as well as reduced the tumors in untreated parts of the mice. The three subjects that relapsed were given a second shot of the new treatment which cleared up the tumors again.When we use these two agents together, we see the elimination of tumors all over the body, Dr. Ronald Levy, professor of oncology said in a university release . Our approach uses a onetime application of very small amounts of two agents to stimulate the immune cells only within the tumor itself. In the mice, we saw amazing, bodywide effects.Levy and his team add that the new treatment could create a fast and inexpensive way to eliminate cancer. Compared to standard treatments which try to stimulate the entire bodys immune system at once and raises costs, the Stanford vaccine only delivers a small amount of medication to a specific tumor area.The next step for the scientists is a small trial with 15 people who have been diagnosed with lowgrade lymphoma. If the injections are successful, Dr. Levy says the treatment could one day eliminate the need for the surgical removal of all kinds of tumors. I dont think theres a limit to the type of tumor we could potentially treat, as long as it has been infiltrated by the immune system.Trump: Disgraceful That Man Illegally In U.S. Killed Edwin Jackson Posted: 06 Feb 2018 08:25 AM PSTCBSAP  President Donald Trump says its so disgraceful that Indianapolis Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson was killed by a person who is in the U.S. illegally.Trump tweeted Tuesday: So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson.

Trump @realDonaldTrump February 6, 2018 Authorities say the man suspected of the drunkendriving crash Sunday that killed Jackson has been twice deported from the U.S.Around 4 oclock Sunday morning in Indianapolis, Jackson and his Uber driver Jeffrey Monroe, were killed. Their car was pulled over on the side of Interstate 70 because Jackson felt sick. Both men were outside the vehicle when a black Ford F150 truck plowed into them. The force of the impact threw one of the men into the center lane where he was later accidentally struck by a state police vehicle. The driver, Manuel OrregoSavala, is a Guatemalan citizen and was deported from the U.S. twice, according to police.OrregoSavala, was arrested with a blood alcohol level nearly three times the legal limit. According to a police affidavit, the suspect used an alias  and was in the country illegally. Investigators say he was deported to Guatemala in 2007 and again in 2009. In Edwin Jacksons first season with the Colts, he was their No. 3 tackler and his teammates, who affectionately called him poundcake, admired him for his hard work and competitive spirit. Last season, he was sidelined with an injury, reports CBS News David Begnaud.

But then the Bulls found a rhythm.Robin Lopez got tossed after two technicals, putting Cristiano Felicio into action. Zach LaVine started facing double teams and all that was left were mostly contested shots late in possessions. The Kings closed with a 6343 advantage in the second half, and the Bulls work was done. They now stand just two games out of the leagues worst record after seven straight defeats, just ahead of the Hawks.And more trades than just Niko Mirotic are likely before Thursdays deadline, with Lopez on the block along with Jerian Grant, Justin Holiday and others. Kris Dunn is well advised to take his time in returning from concussion, and Lauri Markkanen missed the game while being a part of the birth of his son.Its all working out, with two firstplace opponents up next in the Timberwolves and regrouped Wizards.Dan Bernstein is a cohost of 670 The Scores Bernstein and Goff Show in afternoon drive .

Report: Temptations Singer Dennis Edwards Abused Weeks Before Death Posted: 06 Feb 2018 06:32 AM PSTCHICAGO CBS  Chicago police were investigating an allegation of domestic abuse filed just weeks before former Temptations lead singer Dennis Edwards died.Edwards, 74, died Thursday night at Mercy Hospital. He had been ill for months. He had suffered a stroke last year in St. Louis, and had come to Chicago for rehab.Dennis Edwards and The Temptations performs during the Jazz A Vienne festival on July 8, 2013 in Vienne, France. Credit: David RedfernRedferns via Getty ImagesPolice said its unclear if Edwards death was connected to a domestic violence allegation filed last month. The report was filed on Jan 8, and alleged Edwards was the victim of domestic violence in December.Investigators were waiting for a full autopsy report from the Cook County Medical Examiners office.The St. Louis PostDispatch reports an investigator with the Healthcare Consortium of Illinois filed a request for an order of protection on Edwards behalf on Jan. 12. The request accuses Edwards wife, Brenda, tried to suffocate him by holding his head facedown on a bed. According to the PostDispatch, the protection order request claimed Edwards was bed bound and immobile.The PostDispatch reports an emergency protective order against Edwards wife was granted on Jan. 18, barring her from contact with him. He reportedly was removed from their home in Chicago because of medical issues.Elderly Couple Dead In West Garfield Park Fire Posted: 06 Feb 2018 05:13 AM PSTCHICAGO CBS  An elderly man and woman considered fixtures in their community were found dead in a burning apartment building Tuesday morning in the West Garfield Park neighborhood.Around 3:15 a.m., the Fire Department responded to a blaze at a twostory apartment building near Pulaski and Wilcox.When firefighters entered the building, they found an elderly man and a woman unresponsive in the upstairs apartment. Aldonia and Louis White, both 90, were pronounced dead at the scene.Aldonia and Louis White Photo supplied to CBSDeputy District Chief Chuck Maes said the fire appears to have started in the Whites kitchen area, where Aldonia was found dead. Her husband was found in the dining roomliving room area.Possibly, if there was working smoke detectors, it could have alerted them at the time, and they could have got out of the building before the fire escalated, he said.Fire Department Deputy District Chief Jack Nagle said there were smoke detectors in the building, but they werent working.Every time we have one of these tragedies, it seems to be the same thing. Theres either no smoke detectors, or theres no batteries in there, and too soon to tell if it would have made a difference here, but generally its always a possibility, Deputy District Chief Jack Nagle said. A Fire Department spokesman said, based on evidence found at the scene, the fire might be suspicious. The Police Bomb and Arson Unit was investigating the cause of the fire.Witnesses said they saw the blaze before the Fire Department arrived, and tried to help the elderly couple, but couldnt.We saw the fire through the gangway. It was busting the window through the gangway, and the fire was getting real big, Marcus Johnson said. We tried to help them. We tried to get inside, but we couldnt do nothing.Bernetta Sigler, who served as the couples caretaker for the past four years, said when she left the home Monday night, the Whites were doing well. Im just pretty devastated. Its unbelievable, she said. They were great, loving people.Sigler said Louis White was a military veteran who was no longer able to walk on his own. Neighbors said that would have made it difficult for him to escape the secondfloor unit.Despite his disability, Sigler said he never lost his sense of humor.Mr. White, he was always cracking jokes, and just being funny, and loved to sing, she said.Aldonia White was a retired nurse who went from caring for patients to her husband, and in some sense the neighborhood.Mrs. White, she was always strong about kids getting education and staying off the streets, and just wanted everybody just to be good people, Sigler said.Firefighters returned to the block around 10 a.m. to hand out free smoke detectors. Its something the department does after most fatal fires, in the hopes of driving home the point that 60 percent of fatal home fires happen in buildings with no smoke alarms or nonfunctional smoke alarms. Gregg: Ice Dancing  Choctaws, Mohawks, And More Posted: 06 Feb 2018 05:00 AM PSTIn preparation for the upcoming Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, WBBMs Rick Gregg spoke with experts in each of four sports in a series of interviews for WBBMNewsradio.com. Today: Collin Brubaker, a former Team USA Ice Dancer and National Medalist who is now a skating coach in the western suburbs. CHICAGO WBBM NEWSRADIO  Collin Brubaker and his partner, Alissandra Aronow, finished in ninth place in the ice dancing competition at the US Figure Skating Championships in 2014. Thats an impressive finishThe champions and future gold medalists, Meryl Davis and Charlie White, nearly doubled Brubaker and Aronows score.They were in a league of their own, Brubaker said. It wasnt an uncommon thing for them to blow people out of the water by 30, 40, 50 points.ST PAUL, MN  JANUARY 22: Alissandra Aronow and Collin Brubaker compete in the Short Dance at the 2016 Prudential U.S. Figure Skating Championship on January 22, 2016 at Xcel Energy Center in St Paul, Minnesota. Photo by Hannah FoslienGetty ImagesThey are gone from competition now, but Brubaker learned quite a bit from pairing with the two. Lessons he applies as a coach, in the western suburbs.They found a way to make the most of everything, and not give up any points, he said. If you lose a half a point here, and one point there, by doing something silly, by making mental errors, by not holding a position long enough or having just a little slip of an edgetheres just a small margin for error.Competitive ice dancers are nearly always paired for years, and challenge number one is putting a pair together. Both skaters have to be able to tolerate the ups and downs of their other half  nearly every hour of every day.Collin Brubaker photo provided to WBBMYou spend so much time together, Brubaker said  up to eight hours a day, five days a week. You endure the journey of these ups and downs together. Youre pushing your body to the limits, day in and day out. Doing that with a personthat adds something extra. Im not doing pushups by myself, someones sitting on my back while Im doing pushups. Its one of those. But you have to say.even when Im tired, Im in a bad mood, I dont feel good, we have a common goal. I have a responsibility. Professionalism is a huge thing.Brubaker also said longevity of a pair is extremely important, and thats a good thing for Team USA. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th place finishers at Nationals in 2014, finished 1st, 2nd and 3rd in 2018, and will represent the US in South Korea.BOSTON, MA  JANUARY 11: Alissandra Aronow and Collin Brubaker skate in the free dance program during the 2014 Prudential U.S. Figure Skating Championships at TD Garden on January 11, 2014 in Boston, Massachusetts. Photo by Jared WickerhamGetty ImagesAs for Brubaker, hes hoping to develop the next class of ice dance champions.One of the first things that Im looking for is that type of spirit, or big personality that comes out in a skater, he said. Because in dance, theres no comfort zone where you cant be afraid to push the boundaries. You have to explore all options with dance. And to a certain degree, especially from a guy standpoint, you have to have this sense of confidence about you. There is almost a certain degree of arrogance, because you have to look like you know exactly what youre doing. And thats what were trying to sell or portray to the judges. Were selling our performance and the product that weve brought to the ice. That comes with energy, and attitude, and personality.Autistic Whitney Young Senior Who Was Killed Always Had A Smile On His Face Posted: 06 Feb 2018 04:14 AM PSTCHICAGO CBS  Faculty and students at Whitney Young High School on Monday were mourning the loss of a popular special needs student who was stabbed to death at his temporary apartment in the East Garfield Park neighborhood on the West Side.Brandon PorterYoung was a handsome, quiet 18yearold senior who loved playing basketball and gardening, according to a peer and members of the Whitney Young staff.Principal Joyce Dorsey Kenner recalled that the autistic student always had a smile on his face.Brandon PorterYoung Source: Whitney Young High SchoolKenner said PorterYoung, who had a severe learning disability and a profound issue with intellectual capacity, was home alone at the time of his death Friday night.

Dont worry, Dar, you got my half of my pension and youll have Social Security, and youll be able to make ends meet.But Groth had serious problems after she applied for survivors benefits from Social Security last August. She was told the money would arrive in 30 to 45 days, but it didnt.Groth called and came to the Social Security offices in Waukegan multiple times to find out what was going on with her benefits.They said, Well, youre probably being processed, so itll take a little while, Groth says. This is something Im entitled to and your continually telling me Im being processed.During another visit months later, she says another employee told her, Oh my goodness, you must have fallen between the cracks.He said, Watch me, Im going on the computer right now and Im going to make you a priority and I can assure you that within 30 to 45 days youll see that check, Groth says.No dice.I was up the creek without a paddle until I called you, Groth adds.Within days after the 2 Investigators called the Social Security Administration, the sum of 4,594 was deposited in her bank account for benefits due back to August. Her 1,648 benefit check is set to arrive this month.Groth says she was amazed at the quick resolution.A Social Security spokesperson says the normal processing time is about two weeks and Groths fivemonth delay was due to an oversight by an employee. He did not answer questions about exactly what the oversight was, adding they are unaware of any similar complaintsI think this is actually quite common, counters Lawrence Kotlikoff, Professor of Economics at Boston University.Kotlikoff, an outspoken, critic of the Social Security Administration, says deathbenefit payment delays can be a nightmare for grieving spouses.This has to be fixed, Kotlikoff said. Its the right thing to do, and Social Security is an organization that has to be fixed from the bottom up.At least Darlene Groth is now getting her money.You really came through for me and I cant thank you enough, she says.The agency spokesperson also apologized for the inconvenience and said Social Security does everything possible to process widows claims quickly.Analysts: Dow Plunge Not Cause For Panic, Yet Posted: 05 Feb 2018 08:15 PM PSTCBS  Mondays stock market plunge comes on the heels of a big drop Friday.It wasnt a dip. It was a dive.When trading ended, the Dow Jones had dropped more than 1,100 points.The drop, combined with Fridays 600plus decline, equals a 7 percent loss for the Dow.So, why is it happeningThe concern seems to be about inflation getting higher and that higher inflation means the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, says Morningstar.com Editor Jeremy Glaser.That could slow the economy. But Glaser, like other experts, says perspective is key.The market is still way up since it began its climb almost nine years ago.Its not a sign the economy is falling apart. Its not a sign that there should be panic, Glaser says.And its nothing like Black Monday, 1987s 25 percent market drop, or the crash 10 years ago. What it does mean for the 54 percent of Americans invested in the stock market is they may want to stop and reevaluate investments, opting for safer vehicles.If you need your money within a year, get that money out of risk assets. It never should have been there to begin with, says CBS News Business Analyst Jill Schlesinger.

The Best Video Platforms For Your Small Business Posted: 05 Feb 2018 05:00 PM PST Regardless of industry, scale or location, if you are a small business owner you need to be promoting your company with branded videos. As this Forbes article explains, almost half of internet users watch a video related to a product or service before making a purchase. 64 percent of consumers make a purchase after watching a branded social video. With that level of impact, its importance as a promotional tool cant be understated. Here is a rundown of the best video platforms you can use to introduce your company to the world. YouTube With more than 1 billion active users, YouTube is the largest videosharing platform on Earth. If you want to showcase your brand to as many consumers as possible, YouTube is the way to go. Its benefits include an unlimited quantity of highquality video content uploads, robust analytics, and a userfriendly interface. Its popularity among mobile users and the ability to add interactive calltoaction messages at the end of a video are also key features. Google owns YouTube so if you already have a Google account for your business, youre already connected to an entire digital ecosystem, with support.The biggest drawback of using YouTube is that because of its size, your companys ads will have a hard time standing out in an ocean of content. Additionally, its an adsupported platform and users dont get a say in the content of the ads, which may be competitive or even offensive to your business. Vimeo Vimeo is a videosharing platform that made its name by being the first website of its type to host high definition clips in 2007. Today, its better known for cultivating a thriving community of talented content creators that attracts 170 million active monthly viewers. Positive aspects of Vimeo are that its an adfree platform, features embeddable player customization and indepth analytics. It also has a premium account option that includes email capture and video production support. Conversely, it has a smaller active viewer base than YouTube and has limitations on the number of videos users can upload. It also charges businesses a minimum 120 a year to host content. Facebook Although its primary function is not a video platform, there are a few good reasons to host some of your companys promotional clips on the worlds largest social network. Facebook s extensive data mining allows small business owners to specifically target their videos to users who will be most receptive to their message. A recent study found that native Facebook videos get shared 10 times more often than YouTube clips and cost less per 1,000 impressions .Its biggest drawbacks are its algorithms, which effectively will bury videos that dont resonate with users and counts threesecond plays as a view. Also, the fact that Facebook isnt seen as a premier content hub means that it currently functions better as a secondary video advertising channel. Animoto Animoto is an ideal platform for small business owners who dont have much experience working with video. The reason is that its also a videocreation platform that gives users access to a host of editing tools, thousands of commercially licensed songs and more than 100 prefabricated video styles. With those features, owners who know nothing about making videos can create quality clips that will appeal to consumers.

Scientists say that a chemical used in the cooking of the fast food chains french fries may hold the cure for baldness.Researchers at Yokohama National University found that the chemical dimethylpolysiloxane  found in silicone and added to cooking oil as an antifoaming agent  helped to mass produce hair follicles which grew new hair after being placed into mice. According to the findings, published in the journal Biomaterials , Japanese scientists were able to generate nearly 5,000 hair follicle germs HFG which the team said is one of the biggest obstacles in creating hair regenerative medicine.We used oxygenpermeable dimethylpolysiloxane at the bottom of culture vessel, and it worked very well, Professor Junji Fukuda said in a press release . Working with the modified french frycooking ingredient, researchers created HFG chips which carried batches of the new follicles and implanted them into the mice. The chips, transplanted into the backs and scalps of the subjects, reportedly began to grow new black hair from each patch.This simple method is very robust and promising. We hope that this technique will improve human hair regenerative therapy to treat hair loss, Fukuda added.Rep. Jeanne Ives Defends Controversial Campaign Ad Posted: 05 Feb 2018 01:28 PM PSTCHICAGO CBS  Republican State Rep. Jeanne Ives is refusing to take down a controversial campaign ad, despite many denouncing it as offensive and divisive.Now I know there are people here chomping at the bit to chomp me to bits, Ives said at a City Club of Chicago luncheon Monday, where she arrived expecting to defend her commercial against incumbent Gov. Bruce Rauner.The commercial that is generating the expected hysteria from the expected quarters attempted to do, admittedly provocatively, was to properly and truthfully characterize the extreme issue positions Rauner took and their implications. twill ilrevolution  Jeanne Ives @JeanneIves February 5, 2018 The ad shows depictions of constituencies Ives says Rauner has helped, including undocumented immigrants, transgender people and Chicago teachers. As a result, various interest groups are now thanking the governor for standing up for them.Thank you for making all Illinois families pay for my abortions. Thank you for signing legislation that lets me use the girls bathroom, the ad says.Ives says she doesnt know why people are upset, saying, I want to know why people are so offended by it The commercial does not attack people, it tackles issues by truthfully illustrating the constituencies Rauner has chosen to serve to the exclusion of others.Still, she admits the commercial was provocative.State GOP Chairman Tim Schneider said she needs to pull down the ad, and apologize to those who were negatively portrayed in a cowardly attempt to stoke political division.Ives maintains the ad focuses on policy, and is not meant to be offensive to any person or group.Over the weekend, Ives received an additional 2 million donation from conservative businessman Richard Uihlein, who gave her 500,000 last week. Her consultant, Dan Proft, says that money will enable Ives to introduce herself to voters and expose Rauners record through TV ads.Pharmacies Experiencing Flu Vaccine, Tamiflu Shortage Posted: 05 Feb 2018 12:30 PM PSTCHICAGO CBS  The severe flu outbreak gripping Chicago and the rest of the country has doctors urging everyone to get their flu shot.

By DON BABWINAssociated Press CHICAGO AP  A police commander who was killed after a foot chase in downtown Chicago was shot in the head by a suspect carrying a semiautomatic handgun equipped with an extended clip of ammunition, a police official told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The official, who was briefed on the investigation, spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to provide such details until charges are filed against the suspect in the death of Cmdr. Paul Bauer. Bauer, who had been on the police force for 31 years, was shot Tuesday afternoon after spotting a man matching the radio description of an armed suspect, Chicago police have said. The official told the AP that Bauer, 53, had identified himself as a police officer and was trying to trying to detain the suspect when they got into a physical fight and fell down a stairwell that led to a locked underground walkway. Police spokesman Frank Giancamilli would not comment on the weapon but said the suspect was wearing a bulletproof vest under a heavy coat when he was arrested. The Chicago Police Department has said tactical officers had detained the suspect outside the James R. Thompson Center government building when the man fled. Officers initially confronted the suspect because he was acting suspiciously, according to police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. Some initial media reports said the suspect may have been involved in the robbery of a local business, but Johnson did not provide details about what the man was doing that prompted officers to want to speak with him. Officers had been chasing the man on foot when Bauer saw the offender and engaged in an armed physical confrontation, Johnson said Tuesday afternoon. Police captured the suspect a short time later, and a gun was recovered at the scene, he said. I just ask the citizens of this city to keep the Bauer family in their prayers, said Johnson, who choked back tears as he spoke to reporters outside the hospital where Bauer had been pronounced dead. It was initially reported that Bauer was off duty, but police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter late Tuesday that Bauer was on duty. He said in an email Wednesday that it was a chaotic scene and Bauer had been attending training at the Chicago Fire Department with other officials before the shooting. There was no communication from him on the radio informing dispatch that he was in pursuit of the offender or that he was even on scene, so they initially thought it was an offduty officer until someone recognized him, Guglielmi wrote. Mayor Rahm Emanuel called Bauers death a tragic reminder of the dangerous duty the men and women of our police department accept to ensure the safety of us all. Noreen Danko was on her way to her office nearby when she heard the gunshots. I was walking down the street and I heard pop pop pop pop pop, Danko told the Chicago Tribune. And I said to the girl next to me, Is that what I think it is And she said, Yep. I said, Aw geez. And everybody is scurrying all over and I see the police head to the stairs there. She said she saw officers lead the shackled suspect away and put him in a squad car, then watched as emergency workers administered CPR to Bauer, who was lying on a stretcher, before he was put inside an ambulance and rushed to the hospital. ___ This story has been corrected to indicate that the commander was on duty, not off duty, based on updated information from police.

AP PhotoRick Danzl By JAMES BOYD Associated Press CHAMPAIGN, Ill. AP  Close games have not gone well for Illinois this season. The Illini have lost nine games by single digits, including three losses in overtime and one at the buzzer against Nebraska on Jan. 15. But in a rematch Sunday afternoon, the Illini got their revenge in a 7266 victory over the Cornhuskers, powered by Leron Black. Black poured in a careerhigh 28 points and snagged seven rebounds to help Illinois outlast Nebraska. He scored 17 points in 12 minutes in the first half, including a stretch in which he made seven consecutive field goals. My teammates were finding me in all the right spots, Black said. I had a lot of open shots. They were looking for me and getting me the ball. There were six ties and nine lead changes during the game, but the deciding basket came from Black. He nailed a turnaround, fadeaway jumper with two minutes left that put the Illini ahead by three and brought the State Farm Center crowd to its feet. On the Illinis final two possessions Trent Frazier and Mark Smith knocked down four free throws to secure the win. Illinois 1315, 312 Big Ten shot 62 percent from the field and made 7 of 9 from behind the arc to outscore Nebraska 4336 in the first half. But after the break, the Cornhuskers used a 164 run to climb back in it for a fivepoint lead. The teams traded baskets the rest of the way, but Black proved to be too much. He knocked down 3 of 5 from behind the arc in his second consecutive 20point performance. Huge night from Leron, coach Brad Underwood said. Everyone got to see how his game has expanded. He shot a couple off the dribble today, he hit a couple threes. Really pleased with the way he played. Frazier and Kipper Nichols were the only other Illini to score in double figures, finishing with 12 points apiece. Isaac Copeland led the way with 17 points for Nebraska 209, 115, who lost for the just the second time in its past 10 games. We had just kind of gone to sleep in the first half, coach Tim Miles. We hadnt practiced that great coming in and we played that way. BIG PICTURE Glynn Watson Jr., Nebraskas third leading scorer, finished with just three points on 1of9 shooting. The loss snapped the Cornhuskers sixgame winning streak. Illinois slight win should give Underwoods young squad some confidence moving forward as it prepares to close out the regular season. INJURED STARTER Michael Finke missed his third consecutive game with a concussion. The Illinois forward has started in 25 games this season and is the Illinis fourth leading scorer at 9.6 points per game. FRESHMAN HISTORY Frazier has scored in doublefigures in 16 of Illinois last 18 games. Hes averaging 12.3 points this year which is the most by an Illini freshman since Dee Brown during the 200203 season. QUOTABLE You talk about having pride You talk about feeling good Thats everything we have to be about, Underwood said regarding a loose ball scrum in the second half. That was three, four guys on the floor all fighting to win a game. Didnt care about a little burn from the floor, didnt care about getting knocked. Tonight I knew we were in good shape when we were to that point because that is selfless. That was the play of the night in my opinion. UP NEXT Nebraska returns home to take on Indiana. The Hoosiers are led by Juwan Morgan, who is ranked eighth in the Big Ten in scoring at 16.6 points per game. Illinois will hit the road and face Michigan State on Tuesday. The No. 2 Spartans have a 10game winning streak.

176 Max Strus stayed close to home to give DePaul a long-range shooting threat - Chicago Tribune Things went so well for Max Strus on a recruiting trip to Xavier that his parents figured the process was over.We told Max that he didnt have to make the visit to DePaul, said Debra Strus, Maxs mother.But not even Mom and Dad realized how much staying close to home meant to a player known for his long range.That was important to me, said Max, a Stagg High School graduate.DePaul coach Dave Leitao sensed that familyfirst vibe when Strus officially received his release from Division II Lewis University after two outstanding seasons that included a 52point game. So DePauls successful pitch stressed how Strus could lean on his support system in the southwest suburbs during a long, occasionally lonely season he had to sit out under NCAA transfer rules. None of the other programs in pursuit  besides Xavier, Strus also considered Butler, Louisville and Oregon  could beat DePauls geography.Heredity also favored the Blue Demons. DePaul inducted Debra Strus, nee Brinkman, a volleyball and basketball player from 1977 to 1981, into the schools Athletics Hall of Fame when Max was a little boy.But I didnt want to push DePaul at all, Debra said. He had to feel comfortable.It didnt take long for the guy whose goal always was to play Division I basketball to find a comfort zone.After about a week of practice, I took him aside and said I thought he should readjust his expectations because he could go as high as he wanted to dream, Leitao recalled. He has an ability to absorb and understand people, an insatiable work ethic. And, of course, the ease with which he shoots.As natural as the shooting stroke looks for the 6foot6 Strus, basketball happened almost accidentally. The erstwhile quarterback quit football his freshman year after breaking his collarbone for the second time in five years  both injuries oddly occurring on the same day, Oct. 16. The former pitcher considered a college career like his dad, John, a former Eastern Illinois pitcher, but his fondness for basketball grew as he did.A late bloomer at Stagg who was only 59 as a sophomore, Strus received only one scholarship offer, from Chicago State, after his prep career. He landed at Lewis, a respected Division II program in Romeoville where his older brother, Marty, played. In two seasons, Strus dominated, averaging 16.8 points, earning AllAmerica honors and enjoying one of those nights he will relive long after his last shot.Chris Sweda  Chicago Tribune DePauls Max Strus runs down the court at Wintrust Arena on Nov. 11, 2017. DePauls Max Strus runs down the court at Wintrust Arena on Nov. 11, 2017. Chris Sweda  Chicago Tribune It came Nov. 24, 2015, at Midland, Mich., in front of only 385 fans inside Northwood Universitys gymnasium. Strus felt a knot in his neck pregame that made him feel tight. During warmups, he missed more shots than he made.But then my first one went down in the game and the rest was surreal, he recalled.He hit 14 of 18 fieldgoal attempts in a 9995 victory, including 12 3pointers, and all 12 free throws. More importantly, he made an indelible impression in the minds of anybody who saw a videotape of his 52point performance  a Max effort indeed.It was his athleticism as much as his skill, Leitao recalled. No matter who youre playing against, 12 3s is 12 3s.Word spread quickly. Occasionally, his mind wandered. After Lewis lost its final NCAA tournament game in Somers, Wis., Strus discussed his future at dinner with his parents. John Strus trusted the opinion of good friend Jack Fitzgerald, the longtime Richards coach and NBA scout who saw potential for Max to do more on a bigger stage.We said to Max, If you want to do this, were behind you,  John recalled.The toughest conversation involved telling Lewis coach Scott Trost, for whom Strus started 64 games. Trost understood and after Lewis officially granted Strus his release, a flood of Division I coaches called within three hours.I decided to chase my dreams, Strus said.The reality that Strus found his level comes every time he puts on No. 31 for DePaul, which he leads in scoring at 18.2 points heading into Wednesdays game at Georgetown. Hitting 36 percent from 3point range, Strus exploded for 33 against Xavier and Northwestern and scored 27 Saturday against Butler. For the NBA, Strus will need to develop a stronger midrange game. But for DePaul, the junior easily has been the most consistent player for a rebuilding 811 team. Big East defenses have tried anything and everything to harass Strus, who is humble but not shy.If my shot is going, Im pretty hard to guard, Strus said.The pride can be pretty hard to process for his parents, who attend every DePaul game. Maxs brother, Marty, is in his first year as Stagg boys basketball coach. His sister, Maggie, who played volleyball at UIC, just joined the DePaul volleyball staff. Grandparents John Sr., 95, and Mary Jane, 90, still crack a smile reading about their grandson in the sports section. John Strus used the word overwhelming to describe the familys emotions.A couple years ago, Im driving to a Lewis game at Truman State in Kirksville Missouri, where theres one hotel and today I booked for the Big East tournament at Madison Square Garden, John said.It isnt Times Square, but a DePaul billboard on East Jackson features Strus dunking alongside the words Sweet Home Court Chicago. The campus bookstore should consider giving away Strus On The Loose Tshirts to students. Maybe the ticket office can pick up the tab.Before the DePaulNotre Dame game at Wintrust Arena, John Strus says he reserved 200 tickets for family and friends. For DePaulVillanova it was 150.Ive got relatives I didnt know I had, he said.And apparently, they can recruit.dhaugh@chicagotribune.comTwitter @DavidHaughTom Crean, now with ESPN, on a year of transitions: Ive never lost the drive to coach Jack Hoiberg, son of Bulls coach, hopes to make his own name at Michigan State Brad Underwood fighting for culture after Illini fall to 08 in Big Ten Fourstar DePaul to announce college choice today College Basketball Coaches College Sports DePaul Blue Demons Basketball NBA Big East Conference

178 Mekowulu lifts Tennessee State past Eastern Illinois 50-47 Mekowulu lifts Tennessee State past Eastern Illinois 5047 10 hrs ago NASHVILLE, Tenn. AP  Christian Mekowulu scored a careerhigh 27 points and hauled in 10 rebounds to lift Tennessee State to a 5047 win over Eastern Illinois on Saturday night. In a tight game where neither team led by more than five points, Tennessee State 1011, 55 Ohio Valley Conference got a pair of free throws followed by a 3point play from Mekowulu to edge back on top 4945 with 47 seconds remaining. Montell Goodwin sliced the deficit back to two on a jumper at the other end before Mekowulu dropped in another free throw with seven seconds left and Ray Crossland missed a potentially gametying 3pointer just ahead of the buzzer. Mekowulu finished 8 of 14 from the field and missed just four of his 15 free throws to secure the season sweep over Eastern Illinois. Eastern Illinois 714, 37 shot just 29 percent from the field.

By SOPHIA TAREEN and DON BABWINAssociated Press CHICAGO AP  Five years after the largest mass closure of public schools in an American city, Chicago is forging ahead with a plan to shutter four more in one of the citys highestcrime and most impoverished areas. School officials are pitching the new closures around Englewood, a neighborhood on Chicagos South Side, to make way for a new 85 million school they insist will better serve students and reverse low enrollment. But some parents, students and activists are skeptical, saying theyre still reeling from the 2013 closures and the latest plan will make things worse, including the displacement of hundreds of mostly black and poor teenagers. The last thing they should do is close our schools, said 16yearold Miracle Boyd, a student at John Hope College Prep, which could close. They arent the ones sitting in those chairs five days a week struggling to learn because we dont have the necessities we need as students. ... Why not use the 85 million to improve our education and get our schools on the road to success Like other cities, Chicago has long relied on closures to address underperforming and underutilized schools. Significant closures have taken place in Philadelphia, Detroit and St. Louis, but Chicago made history when it closed roughly 50 schools, affecting more than 12,000 students in mostly AfricanAmerican and Latino neighborhoods. The debate over Chicagos latest proposed closures has exploded, with shouting matches and emotional pleas during community meetings. Residents have pleaded with the district to invest more in neighborhood schools and safety. Some have alleged that racial politics are at play. And they worry by pulling students out of schools near their homes and placing them in ones farther away, they are putting them in danger of gang members who will view them as the enemy just by virtue of their address. Chicago Public Schools says nothing is final until an expected Feb. 28 board vote. The nations thirdlargest school district argues its tried to boost enrollment and resources to the four schools, but it hasnt helped. The changes coincide with a major drop in black residents. Roughly 180,000 people moved from Chicago from 2000 to 2010, according to census data. In Englewood, about 10 miles from downtown, fewer than 500 students are enrolled in the four schools. As a result, one freshmen class has only 17 students and another school doesnt offer science. We have to move these kids. They dont have enough support in these buildings, schools chief Janice Jackson said. We cant sit by and continue to watch people leave. The new school, which would open in 2019, will enroll only freshmen at the beginning, and upperclassmen will be left to attend nearby schools. The district expects to spend millions on the transition, including on individualized plans to help students at risk of dropping out, paid summer job programs and possible shuttle buses to transport students. Research on the benefits of school closures is mixed. In 2017, the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado Boulder compiled research finding that even when students transferred to higherperforming schools, those students saw an achievement drop in the first year and marginal gains later on. Theres no ground to stand on for saying this will improve the educational opportunities, said Pauline Lipman, a University of Illinois at Chicago professor who has studied closures. Chicago Public Schools officials disagree. With past closures, theyve emphasized cost savings. This time, theyve pitched the proposal as a more desirable option for students. Renderings of the new school tout outdoor sports facilities and a community health center. City officials say it complements other recent investment in Englewood, including a new lowercost Whole Foods. But critics, including neighborhood activists and unions, say the district didnt do enough to address problems it helped create and theres a lack of trust, especially after two consecutive CPS leaders left office under scandal. The Chicago Teachers Union blames the citys push for charter schools. Roughly 90 percent of Englewoods students travel beyond neighborhood boundaries for school. Experts say property values will drop, vacant buildings are magnets for street crime and sending students to new schools could put their lives at risk. What people dont understand is that if you are 16 years old and get on a bus, when you get off that bus you are gangaffiliated whether you are gangaffiliated or not, said activist Jitu Brown. Tensions between students from different Chicago neighborhoods attending the same school have erupted in violence before. In 2009, 16yearold honor student Derrion Albert was fatally beaten after getting caught in the middle of such a clash. The attack involving students from Fenger High School on Chicagos South Side was captured on cellphone video that was viewed online worldwide. In Englewood, crime is still high despite a significant drop in homicides and shootings there last year. The violence that remains is startling considering the dwindling population. Demographers say Englewoods population decreased from 59,000 residents in 1980 to 26,000 by 2015. In 2016, there were 86 homicides in Englewood, up from 37 the year before. The Chicago district has had trouble selling and repurposing buildings since 2013 and had to loosen guidelines for potential buyers. There are now about 27 schools on that list, but more than a dozen remain empty, including several in Englewood. Among them is Yale Elementary School, which singing and acting star Jennifer Hudson attended. The eerily quiet brick building sits near boardedup homes and empty lots. Letters on the school sign have fallen off. Under the new proposal, one school would remain vacant, two would be taken over by existing charter schools and one would be demolished for the new school. Not everyone opposes the districts plan. It would be a catalyst for new growth in the area. It gives us something that we can build on, here in Englewood, said Theodria Constanoplis, 74. She has lived in Englewood most of her life, and one of her grandchildren could attend the new school. Still, some educators remain skeptical, saying the closures mark the end of an era. Harper High School theater teacher Michael Buino said his students can compete with those who attend schools considered to be Chicagos best. Michelle Obama, who is from Chicago, visited Harper High in 2013 while still first lady. Come to my classroom and see for yourselves, Buino said at a recent community forum. And then tell me Harper is not worth saving. ___ Follow Sophia Tareen on Twitter at https:twitter.comsophiatareen .

181 Illinois rakes in millions in revenue from video game gambling Illinois rakes in millions in revenue from video game gambling Cities like Milan see tens of thousands in profits By: Tahera Rahman Posted: Feb 13, 2018 06:59 PM CST Updated: Feb 13, 2018 06:59 PM CST MILAN, Ill.  Illinois Gaming Boards video gaming records start in 2012. That year the state brought in more than three million dollars. The revenue jumped to nearly 165 million just two years later. That number has almost doubled between 2014 and 2017, coming in at more than 325 million last year. Thousands of those dollars also poured into local governments in the Quad Cities area. The Village of Milan brought in about 9,000 in 2013. Just four years later, the village is raking in seven times that amount. It can cost around 26thousand dollars to set up a video gaming center between municipal liquor licenses, a state gaming license and buying gaming machines. But Bill Cox says it can pay off if you play your cards right. Its profitable. It varies. Some places do 1415,000 a month, he says. Cox opened up six video gaming centers in the Quad Cities area in less than a year. He says small video gaming centers offer more comfort and privacy than casinos. You dont have to worry about the car. They can just pull up and walk in and play and be pretty discreet and no one really knows what theyre up to. I think thats a lot of what it brings to the table, says Cox. There are currently 11 established video gaming centers in Milan, with three more in the process of being approved. They brought in more than 60,000 last year. It goes into our general funds, so thats available for police protection, its available for general operations of the city, says Mark Hunt, Milans finance  economic director. Hunt says the video gaming industry has grown more than anyone expected. Cox is currently applying to open up another center in Milan. The numbers of locations are growing dramatically. It seems like all of them are making their mark and you dont hear about them closing, so thats a good sign on my end, Cox says. But cashing in is causing some concerns. The saturation is kind of getting to a lot of people on the street, I know that. But thats just a part of doing business, so I guess well have to see how it all plays out, says Cox. Some customers also have concerns about the number of gaming centers popping up. They say they hope the city puts a cap on how many machines are allowed in city limits. Milans finance director says right now, there arent any policy changes. Copyright 2018 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

183 Diplomacy toward North Korea is an opening, not a surrender | Chicago Sun-Times The picture of Vice President Mike Pence standing stiffly next to the trusted younger sister of North Korean dictator Kim JongUn at the Olympics in South Korea spoke a thousand words.OPINIONAfter weeks of escalating tensions, the North Korean dictator decided to use the Olympics to reach out to South Korea and to the world. He sent North Korean athletes to the games. The two Korean teams marched into the Olympic arena under a unified flag. They fielded a joint womens ice hockey team for the first time. Kims sister not only attended the ceremonies, but also issued an invitation to the South Korean president to make an official visit to the North after the games.Vice President Pence came to the games to enforce the administrations notalk policy. He stiffed Kims sister on the podium. He and his wife refused to join the crowd in standing when the Koreans marched in.We will not allow North Korean propaganda to hijack the message and imagery of the Olympic Games, he said, vowing to focus on North Korean provocations and human rights abuses, while promising new and harsher sanctions.But the message and imagery of the Olympic Games is that athletes of all nations put aside bitter conflicts to compete in contests. The space for peaceful sports competition could create the opening for serious talks.When campaigning for the presidency, South Korean President Moon Jaein promised an opening to North Korea. The jarring North Korean tests of nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles cast a pall on that. President Donald Trump responded with a characteristic combination of insult and bluster. He infamously strutted that he had a bigger nuclear button than the North Korean president.The administration ratcheted up sanctions, pushed China to get Kim under control, declared that North Korean possession of nuclear weapons was a dire national security threat and ramped up military exercises to the very borders of the North.For our South Korean allies, the escalating threats are bone chilling. There is no rational military option against North Korea. A preemptive attack would be an illegal act of aggression that would lead to massive casualties in both North and South Korea and make the U.S. a pariah among nations.Worse, the military threats only make the North Korean leadership less likely to negotiate away their nuclear weapons program. The U.S. sees North Korean nuclear weapons as offensive, threatening the U.S. and our allies. North Korea clearly sees its nuclear weapons as defensive. For an isolated dictatorship that is denounced by the U.S., a nuclear weapons capacity may serve the same purpose the U.S. claims for its own nuclear arsenal  deterring any country from attacking.President Moon would clearly like to lessen tensions and move toward better relations. He has no desire to distance himself from the U.S., but would like to bring the U.S. and North Korea to the negotiating table.What do Trump and his advisers want The notalk, bigstick policy leads to a dead end. North Korea already has nuclear weapons. Severe sanctions have not slowed its development of intercontinental missiles.The Chinese suggest that talks could start if the U.S. suspends its regular joint military exercises with South Korea and North Korea responds by suspending nuclear and missile tests. Neither the U.S. nor North Korea has expressed support for that.Kim vows to mass produce nuclear weapons Pence demands that North Korea begin denuclearization, the dismantling permanently and irreversibly of North Koreas nuclear and ballistic missile programs before there are any negotiations or loosening of sanctions or suspension of military exercises.A notalk, allswagger policy has produced nothing. If escalating military exercises and threats dont produce a war by miscalculation, they end up advertising the impotence of U.S. policy.Diplomacy isnt a surrender it is an opening. The only way North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons is if it can receive concrete guarantees against foreign attack. The only way we can live with North Korea having nuclear weapons is with dialogue and mutual steps to build trust and security.North Korea is a ruthless dictatorship with a failed economy. South Koreans are understandably fearful of war, but not exactly eager to bear the cost of rebuilding the North. Kim has made an opening gesture at the Olympic Games. Both South Korea and the U.S. have every reason to call his bluff, to seek discussions rather than to continue a notalk policy that leads only to greater tension and frustration. 
184 Mourners: Slain Chicago officer was &#39;one of the good guys&#39; Mourners: Slain Chicago officer was one of the good guys Saturday Feb 17, 2018 at 3:58 PM Feb 17, 2018 at 3:58 PM The Associated Press CHICAGO  Mourners remembered a slain Chicago police commander Saturday as a model officer and one of the good guys who was uninterested in selfpromotion, even as he moved up the departments ranks. Of all of Commander Paul Bauers responsibilities, the ones that mattered the most to him were being a good husband to his wife, Erin, and good father to his daughter, Grace, several speakers said during his funeral at the Nativity of Our Lord Church. Erin and Grace were everything, said former First Deputy Superintendent John Escalante, who grew up with Bauer and served with him for most of Bauers 31 years on the force. Bauer, 53, was gunned down Tuesday near a government building in downtown Chicago. Authorities say he was in a patrol car nearby when he heard a call that a man had run away from tactical officers who had approached to question him about recent drug dealing and a shooting in the area. They say Bauer spotted the man and chased him to an outer stairwell, where they struggled. Bauer was shot six times and was pronounced dead later that day at a hospital. Prosecutors have charged Shomari Legghette, 44, with firstdegree murder of a peace officer, armed violence, the unlawful use of a weapon by a felon and possession of a controlled substance. Legghette, whose criminal record includes a conviction for armed robbery, is being held without bond. Scores of police officers from across the U.S. joined Bauers family, friends and other mourners, including Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Gov. Bruce Rauner and former Mayor Richard Daley, at Saturdays service. Among those attending Fridays visitation and Saturdays funeral were about a dozen honor guard members from the Rockford Police Department. The Rev. Dan Brandt, a Chicago Police chaplain, described Bauer as a man of faith who attended department Bible study sessions and sat in the front row with his family at Mass. Escalante said Bauer skipped his promotion ceremony when he became a captain because he had a family trip, and didnt want to reschedule the ceremony because he didnt need the public accolade. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson recalled Bauer taking time each day to practice English with a department custodian who was learning the language, and that he died doing what came naturally  helping other officers. He was a model police officer, and one of the good guys, Johnson said. Choose the plan thats right for you. Digital access or digital and print delivery.
185 Illinois early voting starts, but not available to all Illinois early voting starts, but not available to all By SOPHIA TAREEN  2818 12:59 AM CHICAGO  Early voting for the primary election is supposed to start Thursday across Illinois, but millions of voters wont have the option because of pending candidate challenges. The states two mostpopulated counties, Cook and DuPage, have delayed early voting until as late as Feb. 21 in order to wait out final decisions on several candidate challenges. But elsewhere, particularly in smaller counties downstate, clerks plan to proceed Thursday, offering caveats to voters who want to cast ballots. The result could be confusion for voters. One candidate ballot challenge has statewide impact. A judge ruled Democratic attorney general candidate Scott Drury cant be on the ballot over questions about his filing of a candidate economic disclosure statement. However, his name will be allowed to remain while he appeals. If Drury is ultimately ruled off, votes for him wont be counted, though he could still run as a writein candidate. Because of that pending decision and others, election officials around Chicago have said they wont be ready by Thursday, in order to have time to test out equipment and prepare ballots in four languages. More than 3.5 million voters in Chicago and surrounding communities in Cook and DuPage counties would be affected. However, other county clerks say theyre ready to proceed Thursday. Ill be open for business, said Madison County Clerk Debbie MingMendoza. Im moving forward. I dont want to delay my voters an opportunity. If they want to come in and vote, I want to be ready to go. There are roughly 182,000 registered voters in southwestern Illinois Madison County, where two candidate challenges are pending. MingMendoza said voters will be notified of the issues. Election officials in far southern Illinois Pope County, where there are about 3,000 registered voters, and eastern Illinois Vermillion County, home to roughly 29,000 registered voters, plan to follow suit. In central Illinois Sangamon County, where there are about 138,000 registered voters, Clerk Don Gray said notifications will be posted in voting areas and voters pulling Democratic ballots will be told about the Drury race. The Illinois State Board of Elections did not have the total number of counties that were delaying but executive director Steve Sandvoss sent a note Wednesday seeking notification from those that werent going to start on time. Though the decision to delay is up to each jurisdiction, he strongly encouraged them to start early voting in a timely manner. Fallout from a delay in early voting could be tough to gauge. Campaigns involved in the March 20 primary havent been pushing the option the same way as years past and turnout in midterm primaries, with contests for statewide offices such as governor and congressional races, is usually low. In 2014, roughly 18 percent of the states approximately 7.5 million registered voters cast primary ballots. In the 2016 presidential primary, Illinois had far higher turnout at roughly 46 percent.

186 Duerson Act would ban pre-teen tackle football in Illinois | WZZM13.com Close Duerson Act would ban preteen tackle football in Illinois SportsPulse: While many sports are seeing rise in youth participation tackle football is seeing a dramatic drop in participation. Nancy Armour details the future of football in America and the NFL. Jimmy Golen and Caryn Rousseau, Associated Press , TEGNA 2:26 PM. EST January 25, 2018 Youth football player in a middle of a game Photo: Thinkstock, Natalya Gerasimova CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE PINTEREST CHICAGO AP  Organized tackle football would be banned for Illinois children younger than 12 years old under a bill to be unveiled on Thursday. The Dave Duerson Act to Prevent CTE is named for the Chicago Bears defensive back who was diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy after he killed himself at the age of 50. Duerson shot himself in the chest so his brain could be studied for signs of the disease that has been linked to concussions or repeated head trauma. When my father tragically took his own life, he donated his brain to science in hopes of being part of the solution, said Tregg Duerson, who like his father played football at Notre Dame. Thanks to increased attention and research on brain trauma, we know that part of the solution is to guard young childrens developing brains from the risks of tackle football, Tregg Duerson said in a statement, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press in advance of the announcement. This bill honors my familys hopes and my fathers legacy to protect future athletes and the future of football. State Rep. Carol Sente, a Democrat from Vernon Hills, announced the proposal at a news conference Thursday along with Chris Nowinski, the head of the Concussion Legacy Foundation. Also expected to attend were former Bears players Mike Adamle and Otis Wilson  a teammate of Dave Duersons on the 1985 championship team  and Liz Nicholson, the wife of former Cleveland Brown Gerry Sullivan, who has sued the NFL over its handling of concussions. We all want kids to have fun playing football and to learn to play the game the right way early on, Sente said in a statement. But the overwhelming data and powerful stories of our supporters here today show the risks of playing tackle football before turning 12 just arent worth it. CTE is a degenerative disease known to cause memory loss, violent moods and other cognitive difficulties in football players, members of the military and others who have endured repeated head trauma. It can only be diagnosed after death. Researchers believe the severity of the symptoms is increased for those who began playing football at a younger age. After years of denials, the NFL has acknowledged a link between head blows and brain disease and agreed in 2015 to a 1 billion settlement with former players. The Illinois bill is similar to a proposal in New York, and Nowinski said lawmakers in at least one other state are working to raise the age at which children begin playing tackle football. I am confident we have the science on our side and can make a very persuasive argument that safer football for youth will lead to healthier and more rewarding lives for generations to come, Sente said.  2018 Associated Press

192 As free agency nears, Bears must make call on some previous buys - Chicago The Bears are nearly six weeks removed from hiring coach Matt Nagy and the calendar is moving quickly for them to put into place plans for the rebuild of the rebuild.The NFL scouting combine begins Feb. 28 in Indianapolis and unlike last year, it doesnt lead directly into the legal tampering period that precedes free agency. A year ago when agents and teams were huddling in Indianapolis, there was almost no window between the end of the combine  where deals are hatched annually  and the period when actual contract negotiating turned legal.This year the negotiating window opens March 12 and the new league year arrives March 14, just more than three weeks off. The Bears, once again, are flush with salarycap space. The team was in excellent cap health when general manager Ryan Pace took over in January 2015 and has remained that way. But gobs and gobs of cap space year after year hasnt necessarily turned into victories in free agency. Of course, the Bears will hope for a better return on their investments this time around. Remember, as tidy as it would be, its impossible to scapegoat departed coach John Fox and his offensive staff for every free agent that turned a short Bears career into a lottery haul without providing much in return. Some flat out stunk. Some were injured and stunk.Key dates ahead Tuesday: This is the first date the NFL clubs can put the franchise or transition tag in place on players and there is a 15day window that closes at 3 p.m. March 6. Cornerback Kyle Fuller is a potential candidate for the tag, which Pace has used previously on wide receiver Alshon Jeffery.March 9: This is the final day for the Bears to pick up the 8 million 2018 option in the contract of left guard Josh Sitton to keep him from becoming an unrestricted free agent.March 12: The negotiating window for agents and teams opens at 11 a.m. While sides can discuss all parameters of a contract, nothing is binding in this period.March 14: New league year begins at 3 p.m. when contracts can be finalized and trades can be executed.March 16: The Bears are in a position where they have to make financial decisions on some of their most ineffective or injured buys in free agency. That cant be an easy process. Yes, they will pay the 3 million roster bonus defensive end Akiem Hicks is due March 16, the third day of the new league year, which is a trigger date for either payments or guarantees for a handful of players. You certainly expect them to pay the 5 million roster bonus that is due right guard Kyle Long that day and chances are good the team also will pay the 1 million roster bonus that is due for right tackle Bobby Massie as well.Beyond those three, decisions for other players on March 16 fall somewhere between a maybe and a hard no. Its reflective of the teams struggles in free agency in some cases. Tight end Dion Sims has a 6 million base salary for 2018 and 4 million of it becomes fully guaranteed if hes on the roster that day. So the Bears are either in or out with Sims after a season in which he produced only 15 receptions for 180 yards and one touchdown in 14 games. Cornerback Marcus Cooper has a 5 million base salary for 2018 and 2 million of it becomes fully guaranteed if hes on the roster that day. You would imagine the same thing goes for Cooper. If the Bears pay him 2 million, theyre unlikely to cut him. He was a major disappointment for 6 million in 2017 and the team will have to ask itself if they can count on him for productivity Outside linebacker Willie Young enters the final year of his contract with a 1 million roster bonus due. Young, who missed 12 games after suffering a torn triceps, has a base salary of 3.5 million. Safety Quintin Demps has a 500,000 roster bonus due. He turns 33 in June and missed 13 games with a fractured left forearm while former draft pick Adrian Amos enjoyed his finest season. Amos base salary is 3 million. Quarterback Mike Glennon has a fully guaranteed 2.5 million roster bonus due March 16. His contract includes offset language, however, so ultimately its possible the Bears dont end up eating any of this or at least just a portion.Timing is such that the Bears potentially could replace one or more of these players in free agency before releasing them. Its certainly possible the team views some moves as addition by subtraction. In total, there are 19 million in base salary guarantees and roster bonuses for eight of the 51 players under contract right now that are triggered on March 16 making it an interesting day to watch.As the Bears prepare to find help in free agency, they have to make calls on a handful of previous additions.bmbiggs@chicagotribune.comTwitter @BradBiggsRoster rundown: At a position of flux, Kyle Fuller helped Bears cornerbacks excel Roster rundown: Danny Trevathan remains anchor for Bears at inside linebacker Roster rundown: Bears forced to juggle as injuries hit outside linebackers Blackhawks Anthony Duclair: Theres a lot more racism than you guys think We need to know the names of those four racists ejected from the Blackhawks game Bears must decide what to do with Kyle Fuller as window for franchise tag opens Privacy Policy Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Coaches Free Agency NFL Ryan Pace Willie Young Mike Glennon Danny Trevathan

198 Hundreds gather at Bridgeport church for Cmdr. Paul Bauer&amp;apos;s wake - Chicago Tribune Hundreds of people formed a line three blocks long outside a Bridgeport church Friday for the wake of police Cmdr. Paul Bauer, who was shot and killed earlier in the week while confronting a suspect in the Loop.The mourners came from all sides of Chicago and the state, driving from as far as Bloomington and Wisconsin to pay their respects. Federal agents, including U.S. marshals and customs officials, stood in the cold outside Nativity of Our Lord Roman Catholic Church. Groups of officers from suburbs including Cicero, Waukegan, Park Ridge, Des Plaines and Oak Brook mingled with Chicago cops of all ranks.Mayor Rahm Emanuel came early, as did former Mayor Richard M. Daley . Also arriving as the wake got underway were two other Daley brothers, Cook County Commissioner John Daley and former White House chief of staff William Daley . Former police Superintendent Garry McCarthy petted a police horse on the backside while greeting an officer outside the church.Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White said he knew Bauer and considered him a friend. The fact that Bauer took it upon himself to join in pursuit of a suspect shows how deeply Bauer took his responsibility to keep the public safe, he said.We lost a hero, White said.Inside the church, Bauers wife, Erin, his 13yearold daughter, Grace, and his father and sisters greeted the stream of wellwishers who filed by the coffin. Flowers lined the church and family photos were on display.Bauer, 53, was shot six times Tuesday near the Thompson Center downtown. His alleged killer, Shomari Legghette, is being held without bond.A 31year veteran of the department, Bauer had worked all over the city, including a stint with the departments elite mounted patrol unit. He was most recently commander of the Near North District, and was the highestranking officer killed on the job in decades.He was downtown when he heard over his radio that officers working a drug detail on Lower Wacker Drive had confronted a suspect who took off running. Bauer apparently confronted a man who matched the suspects description, leading to a tussle and the fatal shooting.Chicago police Deputy Chief Kevin Ryan, who was Bauers boss, said he could always count on him to do the right thing for the right reasons.He never broke the public trust, Ryan said.Ryan said guys like Paul represent the real police.Its not always glamorous, but every day he made a difference for somebody, Ryan said.Chicago police Cmdr. Paul Bauer was shot and killed near the Thompson Center in the Loop on Feb. 13, 2018.Earlier Friday, dozens of police officers stood outside the doors of the church. The officers, along with members of the Chicago Fire Department, lined up in carefully ordered rows flanking the entrance of the building. Fifteen mounted officers lined up across the street. All wore buttons on their coats bearing a photograph of Bauer.The silver hearse containing Bauers body arrived at the church just before 12:30 p.m., led by four officers on foot. Swathed in a Chicago flag, the coppercolored casket was carried into the church by eight pallbearers, all from the Police Department, as those assembled outside saluted.Almost every home on the block displayed a blue ribbon in solidarity. A woman walking home told every officer she came across, Im sorry for your loss, including the officers in line outside her steps.Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson came out afterward to talk to reporters. He thanked the public for its support during what he said was a very difficult time.The healing process starts today for CPD and the family, he said.Johnson encouraged those attending the parade to be held in Bauers honor Saturday to wear blue in support of the late officers family.As the skies darkened late Friday afternoon, the line inching into the church in Bridgeport numbered about 1,000 people at any given time. Those who braved the cold repeatedly expressed their respect for the police and Bauer.One officer from Palatine said Bauers death reverberated beyond Chicago and called it a national tragedy.Four members of the Milwaukee Police Departments honor guard had driven south to pay their respects. Its a brotherhood, said Elvis Lock, one of the Wisconsin officers. We consider this our family.Retired Chicago police officer Anthony Ortiz said he didnt know Bauer particularly well except by reputation. But he felt he needed to come out and show respect for his fellow officer, and the job.Always a good man. Always a good policeman, Ortiz said. Cant ask for more than that.eolumhense@chicagotribune.comgpratt@chicagotribune.comRELATEDSlain Cmdr.

203 Chicago suburbs survive snowstorm SCHAUMBURG, Ill.  The Chicago suburbs got slammed by an overnight snowstorm. Highways and local streets were left snowcovered and treacherous. Multiple spinout accidents were reported in communities like Joliet, Channahon, Crest Hill, Shorewood and Bolingbrook  to name a few. Many suburban school systems chose to close for the day so did Chicago Public Schools . And many government offices , including Illinois Secretary of State offices, closed their doors for the day. As a result, expressway travel times, which could have been nightmarish, were actually shorter than normal for the morning rush. 42.033361 88.083406

India starts her statement with one word: Worthy. She then continues her note by referring to her Grammy preshow performance of I Am Light. She writes, In this performance, Worthy is behind me on this stage, because it is my favorite word, my mantra, my lifes philosophy. I KNOW NOW, with NO uncertainty, that regardless of the lack of compassion and fairness that the world shows us at times, That I AM WORTHY WE ALL ARE. My favorite definition of this word is: deserving of regard and respect. And anytime someone comes to treat me as less, I know THEY are mistaken. India adds, Neil Portnow is mistaken. His statements are a mess, but I get why he cant empathize with women and women of color. HE is saying, the more women there are, the more chances women have to WIN. She continues, BUT. WE NEED MORE WOMEN, more WOMEN OF COLOR AND MORE INCLUSIVE MINDED PEOPLE in positions of power, in the rooms where decisions are made.

212 Former Rock &amp;apos;n&amp;apos; Roll McDonald&amp;apos;s gets new ecofriendly look from riverwalk architect - Chicago Tribune The former Rock n Roll McDonalds will reopen in late spring with more trees and a sleeker, more contemporary design, courtesy of Carol Ross Barney, the renowned architect who codesigned the Chicago Riverwalk.A popular tourist attraction for decades, Chicagos flagship McDonalds is undergoing a major remodeling to reflect the global fastfood chains pivot toward the future. Gone will be the remaining rock memorabilia and giant yellow arches, to be replaced by ordering kiosks, living plant walls and solar panels.Once finished, a 19,000squarefoot onestory restaurant constructed of timber, steel and glass will replace the twostory, 24,000squarefoot McDonalds that opened in 2005, which supplanted the original building that opened in 1983. The new design aims to be more pedestrianfriendly  there will be less parking  and more energyefficient and environmentally friendly throughout.But, as franchise owner Nick Karavites pointed out, the ultimate goal of business is to make money.Theres a lot of pride being part of something so cuttingedge.  At the end of day, were still a business selling hamburgers and french fries and milkshakes and we want to sell as many as we can, said Karavites, whose familys franchise group owns 24 McDonalds restaurants in the Chicago area.As for those glowing yellow arches that are coming down, Ross Barney said: The symbolism was appropriate for its time, but its time to move on.That statement could be applied to much of what McDonalds has done in recent years as the company has made moves to break from its past, including demolishing a longtime company museum in Des Plaines and moving its headquarters this spring, from Oak Brook to Chicagos Fulton Market district. McDonalds also has launched a flurry of initiatives for future growth, including recently starting a new value menu and introducing more premium products along with delivery and curbside pickup options.Perhaps the most striking feature of the interior design rendering provided by McDonalds is the floating glass garden of ferns and white birch trees above the area where customers will place their orders, either at kiosks or at the counter. Much of the dining area is partially sectioned off from the flow of customer foot traffic to the ordering area. Employees will carry food out to customers  part of McDonalds experience of the future model that the company is in the process of rolling out to all U.S. locations.Outside, there will be more than 70 trees  roughly double the previous number  and an outdoor plaza area with seating. Solar panels will cover most of the roof and help offset nonrenewable energy costs. Atop the kitchen, which partially juts out from the glass building, will be harvestable apple trees, said Ross Barney, founder of Ross Barney Architects.PHOTOS: Renderings from McDonalds depict the new restaurant planned for Clark and Ontario streets in Chicago, while photos show demolition work continuing Jan. 29, 2018, on the McDonalds restaurant currently at the River North site. The restaurant is being modernized to include ordering kiosks and improved energy efficiency.Riverwalk architect learned environmental lessons early, in Peace Corps Youll be able to look up at the apple trees while youre eating your hamburger or whatever, Ross Barney said.Ross Barney and her firm have garnered numerous accolades for their work on the riverwalk, on which they partnered with Sasaki Associates of Watertown, Mass. Ross Barney is also known for her recent design of notable public spaces, including new CTA stops at McCormick Place and Morgan Street on the Near West Side.This is her first McDonalds.Its so interesting to work on a project like this because youre designing for an icon, Ross Barney said.Ross Barney said she considered the fastfood restaurant, like other projects in her portfolio, to be an opportunity to improve upon a public gathering space and, ultimately, make the city more livable for its residents. She was also drawn to McDonalds desire for a more energyefficient design  a personal passion of hers. Everything from the buildings heating and cooling system to the fryers are designed to use less nonrenewable energy.And though theres still a drivethru, as well as a curbside pickup area for mobile ordering, the design is intended to attract more people on foot, she said.The major change here is theres been a rebalancing to where the design is about the neighborhood and its about people, Ross Barney said.This year, McDonalds plans to invest 2.4 billion in capital projects, most of which will go toward ongoing work in converting U.S. locations to the experience of the future model, which includes ordering kiosks, table service and increasing use of the mobile app, the company said Tuesday. This year, the company plans to convert another 4,000 U.S. restaurants, which will mean roughly half of the approximately 14,000 U.S. McDonalds will have adopted the experience of the future concept. The plan is to overhaul most freestanding U.S. restaurants by 2020.Chicagos Rock n Roll McDonalds to close for remodeling, ditch rock theme Karavites restaurant at Clark and Ontario streets will be one of the largest McDonalds of the future.While McDonalds recent initiatives have been a lot for franchisees to digest, Karavites excitement about the new design is evident.Though the remodeled restaurant will be smaller, it will feel more spacious, in part because the glass walls wont be angled inward like they were in the last design, Karavites said. And though there will be a few less seats without the second floor, Karavites said he was pleased to see the company take a more thoughtful approach to improving the dining experience.Because its a flagship store, the company  and not Karavites  is shouldering the bulk of the costs associated with the project, he said. McDonalds spokeswoman Terri Hickey declined to provide specific figures or terms of the agreement.The restaurant usually employs about 120 workers, ranging up to 160 in the busy summer months. Karavites said an uptick in sales because of the new design could in turn mean more hiring.The original Rock n Roll McDonalds was razed in 2004, but many Chicagoans continued to refer to its twostory replacement with the same name. But the remaining rock memorabilia, owned by Karavites, is now in storage.What will it be called now that rock n roll has left the buildingUltimately, that will be up to the customers.Internally, we call it the Rock, Karavites said. Im going to continue calling it that.gtrotter@chicagotribune.comTwitter @GregTrotterTribBoeing profit blows past estimates with help from U.S. tax cut Longdreaded Amazon threat to drug middlemen draws closer Quiksilver CEO is missing: His boat washed up in France, empty Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Architecture McDonalds

219 Schools across Illinois struggle to find substitute teachers Illinois schools struggle to find substitute teachers Jan 25, 2018 Save BELLEVILLE, Ill. AP  Many school districts across Illinois are experiencing substitute teacher shortages, a survey shows. The survey of more than 500 superintendents was conducted by the Illinois Association of Regional Superintendents of Schools. Superintendents in southern Illinois described their shortage as more severe than most in other areas of the state. Some school officials have been recruiting substitute teachers by posting on social media, attending job fairs and asking parents for help. Several others have been offering substitute teachers more money. Illinois accepts applications for substitute teaching licenses from people who have bachelors degrees in any subject area. The application costs about 160 to 175 for the application, registration and other costs, including a background check. Most of the cost comes from the states licensing fees and can be reimbursed after 10 days on the job. The refunds are a new effort by the state to address the substitute teacher shortage. But the association suggests that further policy changes are needed at the state level to help schools recruit more substitute teachers, The Belleville NewsDemocrat reported. The association recommends amending the Teachers Retirement System. Retired teachers are limited in how often they can work and still receive pension payments. They are only allowed to work 100 days or 500 hours in a school year. The association said increasing the number of days and hours that retirees can work would significantly relieve pressure on schools.

223 Illinois man sentenced to prison in credit union, bank robberies | Local Crime &amp; Courts | qctimes.com Save A Bloomington, Illinois, man was sentenced Wednesday to 10 years in federal prison for robbing a Bettendorf credit union and an Illinois bank in 2016. Anthony Jovon Brown, 33, was ordered to pay to pay 1,615 in restitution to Ascentra Credit Union and 10,860 in restitution to DeWitt Savings Bank in Clinton, Illinois. He must serve three years of supervised release once he completes his prison term. There is no parole in the federal system. Brown pleaded guilty last year to two counts of bank robbery in U.S. District Court, Davenport. The bank robbery charge related to the incident in Clinton was transferred from the Central District of Illinois, according to court documents. According to court documents in the Bettendorf case: Bettendorf Police were called about 11 a.m. Aug. 18, 2016, to Ascentra Credit Union, 1710 Grant St., for a report of a robbery. Police learned that Brown walked into the credit union wearing a black floppy hat, black sweatshirt, blue jeans and black Nike shoes with a white swoosh. He waited in the lobby until other customers conducting business left. While waiting, Brown retrieved a credit union form that is used for deposits, withdrawals and fund transfers. He held onto the form in his bare hands while waiting in line. Brown then approached the counter and made a verbal demand for money from the teller. He produced a paper bag, which the teller filled with 4,646. Brown retrieved the bag but left the form at the tellers window. He left in a goldbrown Chevrolet Impala that was parked in an adjacent lot. Officers determined that fingerprints found on the transaction form belonged to Brown. They also compared Browns drivers license photo to still images taken from surveillance footage at the time of the robbery. On Aug. 23, 2016, police arrested Brown at his relatives home in Bloomington. Officers found clothing that appeared to be similar to those worn by the credit union robber. They also found 3,031 in the pocket of a black sweatshirt that was recovered. Part of the money was in a plastic bag, while some was in a cup inside another bag. Officers also located a 2003 Chevrolet Impala, registered to Brown, in the driveway. Inside, they found a hat similar to the one worn during the credit union robbery. The next day, Brown was interviewed by Bettendorf police and the FBI at the McClean County Jail. Brown said during the interview that he robbed the credit union and that he used some of the money on food, gas, marijuana and a trip to St. Louis, according to court documents. According to an indictment filed in the Clinton case, the robbery occurred on July 1, 2016. Love

236 Inmates who clapped for Chicago cop death suspect may face reprisals | State and Regional | herald-review.com Inmates who clapped for Chicago cop death suspect may face reprisals DON BABWIN Associated Press Buy Now Chicago police officers arrive for a news conference at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, regarding Cmdr. Paul Bauer, who was killed earlier in Chicago on Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2018. The offduty police commander was shot and killed Tuesday afternoon in downtown Chicago after he spotted a man matching the radio description of an armed suspect officers were chasing on foot, the citys police superintendent said. Nuccio DiNuzzoChicago Tribune via AP Nuccio DiNuzzo Save CHICAGO  Five Cook County Jail inmates who applauded as the man charged with the fatal shooting of a Chicago police commander was led by their cell could face reprisals for their actions, a jail official said Friday. Cara Smith, the chief policy officer for Sheriff Tom Dart, said a security video shows them clapping as suspect Shomari Legghette was being led past a crowded holding cell on Thursday after his first court appearance. The inmates were in the holding cell awaiting action on their cases. Legghette is charged with firstdegree murder in Tuesdays shooting death of Commander Paul Bauer. She said the five inmates were transferred overnight from Chicago to a jail in southern Illinois, where it will be more difficult for family and friends to visit them while they are in custody. Suspect in Chicago police death charged with murder CHICAGO  A man with a long criminal history that includes a conviction for armed robbery ha The jail also is forwarding to prosecutors the video and reports of the incident Thursday afternoon so they can use the information if the inmates are convicted, she said. The conduct that those detainees engaged in was disgraceful... and speaks to their character, Smith said. We feel it should be considered by prosecutors in connection with their sentencing. The video could be a factor of aggravation considered by a judge in sentencing. But Steve Greenberg, a prominent Chicago defense attorney, said there is no way the inmates should be penalized for what he said is a clear exercise of their right to free speech. These inmates ... no matter how vile or disgusting you may think their expression is, they have an absolute right under the First Amendment to express those feelings and it is a violation of their rights as citizens to penalize them or consider that as aggravation, said Greenberg, who is not representing any of the men. The video was taken moments after the 44yearold Legghette appeared in court on charges of firstdegree murder of a peace officer, armed violence, unlawful use of a weapon by a felon and possession of a controlled substance. Police say they wanted to question Legghette Tuesday when he took off running and Bauer pursued him on foot. He caught Legghette near the James R. Thompson Center, a government building, where the two struggled and Legghette fell down the stairs. Bauer either fell or ran after him to a landing where, Legghette, wearing a bullet proof vest and armed with a semiautomatic handgun, allegedly shot the 53yearold Bauer six times. Bauer, a 31year veteran of the police force, was pronounced dead a short time later. City mourns a hero Hundreds of people formed a line three blocks long outside a Bridgeport church Friday for Bauers wake. Police officers from around the state and federal agents, including U.S. marshals, stood in the cold outside Nativity of Our Lord Roman Catholic Church to show their respect. Groups of officers from such places as Cicero, Waukegan, Park Ridge, Des Plaines and Oak Brook mingled with Chicago cops of all ranks. Almost every home on the block displayed a blue ribbon in solidarity. A woman walking home told every officer she came across, Im sorry for your loss, including the officers who stood in line outside her steps. Mayor Rahm Emanuel came early, as did former Mayor Richard M. Daley. Also arriving were two other Daley brothers, Cook County Commissioner John Daley and former White House chief of staff Bill Daley. Former police Superintendent Garry McCarthy petted a police horse on the backside while greeting an officer outside the church. Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White who has a facility in Decatur said he knew Bauer and considered him a friend. The fact that Bauer took it upon himself to join in pursuit of a suspect shows how deeply Bauer took his responsibility to keep the public safe, he said. We lost a hero, White said. Inside the church, Bauers wife, Erin, his 13yearold daughter, Grace, along with his father and sisters greeted the stream of well wishers who filed by the coffin. Flowers lined the church and family photos were on display. Chicago police Deputy Chief Kevin Ryan, who was Bauers boss, said he could always count on him to do the right thing for the right reasons. He never broke the public trust, Ryan said. Ryan said guys like Paul represent the real police. Its not always glamorous but every day he made a difference for somebody, Ryan said. Four officers from Milwaukee police departments honor guard drove south to pay their respects. Its a brotherhood, said Elvis Lock, one of the Wisconsin officers. we consider this our family. Earlier Friday, dozens of police officers stood outside the doors of the church. The officers, along with members of the Chicago Fire Department, lined up in carefully ordered rows flanking the entrance of the building. Fifteen mounted officers lined up across the street from that group. All wore buttons on their coats bearing a photograph of Bauer. The silver hearse containing Bauers body arrived at the church just before 12:30 p.m., led by four officers on foot. Swathed in a Chicago flag, the coppercolored casket was carried into the church by eight pallbearers, all from the Police Department, as those assembled outside saluted. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson came out afterward to talk to reporters. He thanked the public for its support during what he said was a very difficult time. The healing process starts today for CPD and the family, he said. Johnson encouraged those attending the parade to be held in Bauers honor Saturday to wear blue in support of the late officers family.

241 In and out of Chicago Hello there, My wife and I are over from the UK end of Sep 18 for 2 weeks, flying into and out of Chicago. We have our first 3 nights in Chicago, and Im sure we will find stuff to do there  no problem. Were taking in the Smoky Mountains most likely staying in Gatlinburg for 4 nights  so any recommends for a 1 night stop off on the way south from Chicago gratefully received, Nashville for 2 nights and 2 nights in Memphis to take in Graceland of course and the surrounding area. I also fancy the Harley Davidson museum in Milwaukee. So, the big question is  and taking someall of our preferences into account  what would be the best trip to take in terms of sights etc. We both love small town America, Americana, talking to the locals, wildlife, scenery and just immersing ourselves into the American way of life. After a little research were thinking we might do St Louis and Springfield IL the Abraham Lincoln thing coming back north. Thank you for your time. Regards, Paul  Deanie

CHICAGO AP  Authorities say a serial stowaway who sneaked onto plane in Chicago earlier this month and made it to London has been arrested again after being spotted at OHare International Airport. Marilyn Hartman, of Grayslake, was taken into custody early Sunday and charged with misdemeanor trespassing on state land and violating the conditions of her bail bond that were set last week by the judge who warned her to stay away from airports. Police say they were responding to a call of someone refusing to leave the airport when they spotted the 66yearold Hartman at a terminal. Hartmans most recent arrest came after police say she slipped past a security checkpoint at OHare and boarded a flight without a ticket or boarding pass. She was arrested in London and flown back to Chicago. Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

KimChicago Tribune via AP prev next comments CHICAGO  A man with a long criminal history that includes a conviction for armed robbery has been charged with firstdegree murder in the fatal shooting of a Chicago police commander, authorities announced Wednesday.Shomari Legghette, 44, was also charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm, armed violence and possession of narcotics after police say they discovered he was carrying heroin, crack cocaine and marijuana. Legghette was armed with a semiautomatic handgun that had a 30round magazine, and was wearing body armor under a heavy black jacket, police said.At an emotional news conference Wednesday, police Superintendent Eddie Johnson talked about the suspect, but also described Cmdr. Paul Bauers final moments as he assisted other officers Tuesday afternoon in pursuit of Legghette.When Paul heard the radio call, he didnt turn the other way to let someone else worry about it, Johnson said. He didnt worry about his rank or the fact that he wasnt in his own district. He just ran towards where he was needed without hesitation.The 53yearold Bauer, wearing his police uniform, was in his car after having lunch near the James R. Thompson Center, a downtown government building, when he heard the call, police said Wednesday. Tactical officers had approached Legghette in an area where there had been reports of drug sales but Legghette ran away before they reached him.Bauer, a 31year department veteran, jumped from his car and ran after Legghette, who matched the description that he heard on his radio. Police said Bauer chased Legghette to the top of a stairwell, where the two fought, before Legghette grabbed him and the two of them fell down the stairwell.Area Central Detectives Commander Brendan Deenihan said witnesses said  and an audio recording from a nearby taxi confirmed  that seven shots were fired at the bottom of the stairwell. All the shots came from the gun that Legghette was carrying and officers later recovered, Deenihan said.Bauer did not draw his weapon, Deenihan said.Police officers arrested Legghette a short time later in the stairwell.A person who was briefed on the investigation but was not authorized to speak said Bauer was shot multiple times in the head. The person spoke on condition of anonymity. Officials did not discuss this detail at the news conference and the medical examiners office only said that Bauer was shot to death.Legghette has been arrested repeatedly and, according to the Illinois Department of Corrections, he has several felony convictions on his record dating back to the 1990s that have landed him in prison. Most of them are drugrelated, but his record also includes crimes that show a willingness to use a gun.According to the Department of Corrections, he was sentenced to prison in 1999 for armed robbery and after he was released, he was arrested again and sentenced to prison for possession of a firearm with a defaced serial number. Legghette was released from prison in 2008 before returning the next year after being convicted again for possession of a firearm with a defaced serial number.Shortly after he was placed on parole, he returned to prison after it was revoked when he tested positive for drugs. He returned to prison again in 2015 after he was convicted for possession of a controlled substance.One arrest in particular struck Johnson as a chilling prelude to what unfolded on Tuesday.In 2007, he was arrested for unlawful use of body armor, unlawful use of a weapon, armed violence and drug possession, the police superintendent said.Johnson, who has repeatedly urged lawmakers to pass tougher laws to keep repeat gun offenders locked up, said Legghettes record should have forfeited his right to freedom.Some people dont deserve to walk the streets of Chicago, Johnson said. He was one of them.It was a similar message that Bauer himself shared at a gathering of business professionals just a few months before he died.Even when we catch somebody, theres still a long way to go to get them off the street, Bauer said at the Nov. 14 gathering, according to a report in the Loop North News. Were not talking about the guy that stole a loaf of bread from the store to feed his family. Were talking about career robbers, burglars, drug dealers. These are all crimes against the community. They need to be off the street.Deenihan said Legghette has refused to talk to police. He is in custody and is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday.
249 STOCKS ON TRACK FOR BEST WEEK SINCE ’16… SEC Blocks Chinese Takeover of Chicago Stock Exchange February 16, 2018 Stocks close higher for fifth straight session as Dow reclaims 25,000level The Dow rose to close above the 25,000 mark Thursday for the first time in nearly two weeks as U.S. stocks finished higher for a fifth straight session in volatile trade. Wall Street opened solidly higher but subsequently lost ground before recouping losses, supported by the latest data on inflation and the labor market, which pointed to an economy that was growing but in no imminent danger of overheating. Strong results at Cisco also highlighted how American corporations continue to fare well in the current environment. How did the main benchmarks perform The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, 1.23 rose 306.88 points, or 1.2, to 25,200.37. The SP 500 SPX, 1.21 added 32.57 points, or 1.2, to 2,731.20. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, 1.58 gained 112.81 points, or 1.6, to 7,256.43. So far this week, the Dow and the SP are both up more than 4 and on track for their biggest weekly percentage rise since November 2016. The Nasdaq is up over 5, which represents its best week since October 2014. Those gains come after sharp losses seen earlier this month, which pushed the Dow and SP into correction territory, or a 10 drop from a peak. The three gauges stand between 4 and 6 below last months alltime highs. The selloff was sparked in part by rising bond yields amid signs of an uptick in inflation, with the higher yields luring money out of equities. Strategists have said the selloff was overdue, but was excessive . SEC blocks Chicago Stock Exchange sale to Chinabased investors Reuters  U.S. regulators on Thursday killed the politically sensitive sale of the Chicago Stock Exchange CHX to a group led by Chinabased investors, saying a lack of information on the wouldbe buyers threatened the ability to properly monitor the exchange after the deal. The move by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ends a twoyear battle to gain approval for the sale and underscores the more hostile environment facing Chinese buyers under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump brought the CHX deal up twice during the election campaign as an example of how jobs and wealth were leaving the United States. SEC staff initially approved the sale of the privately owned exchange in August, but within minutes of the announcement SEC commissioners, led by Chairman Jay Clayton, a Trump appointee, put the decision on hold for further review. U.S. lawmakers from both parties had harshly criticized the deal in joint letters to the SEC, arguing that it would give the Chinese government access to American financial markets and questioning the SECs ability to regulate and monitor foreign owners.

256 New OC Rod Smith vows to spice up Illinois offense New OC Rod Smith vows to spice up Illinois offense By The Associated Press January 26, 2018 6:13 pm 01262018 06:13pm Share CHAMPAIGN, Ill. AP  Rod Smith had a bit of music for the ears of Illinois fans who watched the Illini scuffle along on offense last season. Were going to try to make them defend the entire field, said Smith, who was formally introduced Friday as the new offensive coordinator at Illinois. I think the hardest skill to do in football is tackle a skillkid in open field. . Were going to try to get guys out in space. Smith spent six years as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Arizona, helping establish it as one of the best offensive teams in the country. Last season, the Wildcats averaged 41.3 points fifth in the FBS and 489.5 total yards per game. A lot of that success was because of Khalil Tate, a dualthreat quarterback who scored 26 total touchdowns. The situation under center isnt as clear at Illinois. Last season, the Illini averaged just 15.3 points 126th in the FBS, 280.4 yards of total offense and never scored more than 24 points in a game. Coach Lovie Smith started three different quarterbacks but wound up 210 overall and 09 in the Big Ten. I think most of our fans will agree, we need to score more points, Lovie Smith said. Its as simple as that. Two of those three starting quarterbacks are no longer with the team, leaving sophomore Cam Thomas as the only scholarship quarterback on the roster. Thomas appeared in four games, starting two, but completed just 42.4 percent of his passes and throwing five interceptions. He never scored through the air, but had 52 rushes for 233 yards and a touchdown. Still, the Smiths said they will look to add more experience. Regardless of who starts at quarterback, Rod Smith said he plans to implement a spread, runfirst offense. In 2017, Arizona averaged nearly 46.9 passes and 22.7 rushes per game. Illinois has a number of young playmakers returning. Sophomore running back Mike Epstein missed the last seven games of the season with a foot injury, but still finished with a teamhigh 346 rushing yards and three touchdowns. Sophomores Ricky Smalling and Louis Dorsey proved to be two of Illinois best pass catchers. Smalling averaged a teamhigh 16.5 yards per catch and led the Illini with 510 receiving yards. Dorsey led all tight ends with 395 receiving yards and hauled in a teamhigh three touchdowns. Epstein, Smalling and Dorsey were three of 16 true freshmen starters last year, the most in school history. When you play so many freshmen, its tough, Rod Smith said. Thats tough sledding, particularly in the Big Ten. But thatll pay off. . Hopefully we start reaping some of those benefits in the spring. Copyright  2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

257 Chicago Stock Exchange mulls options after sale blocked Chicago Stock Exchange mulls options after sale blocked Adds quotes from CHX background on deal that was blocked By John McCrank NEW YORK, Feb 16 Reuters  The Chicago Stock Exchange said on Friday it was evaluating its options after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission blocked the sale of the bourse to a group of U.S. and Chinabased investors due to the opaque nature of the buyers and their funds. The SEC killed the politically sensitive deal on Thursday, ending a twoyear effort to sell the exchange, known as CHX, to a consortium of investors led by Chinas Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group and its U.S. affiliate North American Casin Holdings. By disapproving the transaction, the SEC has denied the American public an historic and unprecedented opportunity to build a mutually beneficial economic bridge between the worlds largest economies, while unfairly disadvantaging our company and shareholders, CHX said in a statement. SEC staff initially approved the roughly 25 million deal for the privately held exchange. But the agencys commissioners, led by Jay Clayton, an appointee of U.S. President Donald Trump, stayed the decision pending their own review. CHX, a niche player with a market share of around 0.5 percent, had hoped the deal would help it become a conduit for Chinese companies to list in the United States. Casin also said it planned eventually to build an exchange in China using CHX technology. But on Thursday the SEC said CHX could not provide key information it had requested, including access to the potential owners books. The SEC also said the deals structure could let new, unknown entities assume stakes over time and that, overall, it was not convinced the exchange would be properly monitored after a deal. The SEC order contains logic and representations with which CHX strongly disagrees, the exchange said. The deal was proposed in February 2016 and was the target of harsh criticism by a group of lawmakers led by Republican Congressman Robert Pittenger. They claimed in letters to the SEC that Casins control of CHX could allow the Chinese government access to American financial markets. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which scrutinizes acquisitions for potential national security concerns, approved the sale in August 2016, but it ultimately hinged on SEC approval.

Junior power forward Leron Black scored a careerhigh 28 points in the win. Illinois is yet to win a Big Ten road game this season. The Illini, one of four threewin teams in the Big Ten, is locked in to one of the 1114 seeds in next weeks Big Ten tournament, meaning theyll begin play Wednesday at Madison Square Garden in New York. MSU update: The Spartans are coming off the largest comeback in Big Ten history, from 27 points down to beat Northwestern on Saturday. It was MSUs 10th straight win and puts the Spartans all alone in first place in the Big Ten standings, a game up on Ohio State and Purdue. MSU can clinch at least a share of the conference title with a win Tuesday over an Illinois team it beat by doubledigits a month ago in Champaign. This is the final home game for three MSU seniors, reserves Tum Tum Nairn, Gavin Schilling and Ben Carter, and likely the last game at Breslin Center for sophomore Miles Bridges and freshman Jaren Jackson Jr., both of whom are considered lottery picks in the upcoming NBA draftMORE: Couch: Tum Tum Nairn leads a senior class that Tom Izzo didnt want but is grateful for  About the matchup: The last time these teams met, Jan. 22 in Champaign, MSU couldnt miss but couldnt hang on to the basketball  shooting 68 percent as a team, while committing 25 turnovers. The Illinis defense is known for making opponents speed up uncomfortably, which explains some of the carelessness. Teams are also shooting almost 47 percent against Illinois, which partly explains MSUs percentage that night. Sophomore forward Nicholas Kipper scored a careerhigh 27 against the Spartans last time out, hitting 5 of 8 3pointers. Hes since been added to the starting lineup. On most nights, Illinois simply doesnt have the offensive firepower or rim protection to stay with MSU. Prediction: If this were a late January game, perhaps a snowy midweek night in the middle of a long stretch, maybe MSU might sleepwalk into an upset scare against Illinois. But this is senior night, with a Big Ten title on the line, coming off a game where MSU sleepwalked through the first half. Meanwhile, Illinois just had its own satisfying big win at home. The dynamic doesnt set up well for the Illini.

262 National Study Hammers Illinois Budget Practices By Sean Crawford  Jan 23, 2018 A national study of state government budgeting gives Illinois low marks. Credit Brian Mackey Its no surprise to see Illinois fare poorly when it comes to finances. A two year budget impasse created even more problems. Its hard to gauge the success of the budget in Illinois when you didnt have one, said Bill Glasgall with the nonpartisan Volcker Alliance, which conducted the analysis titled Truth And Integrity In State Budgeting: What is The Reality The Alliance graded the states in categories like budget maneuvers, forecasting, reserve funds and more. Each state was given a grade, with Dminus being the lowest. Among all states, Illinois was near the bottom for how it puts budgets together and deals with what it owes. Glasgall said during the impasse, the state continued to spend more money than it was taking in. The state whipped out its credit card and put 16million dollars on account, he said. That to me is a sign of, if not fiscal distress, darn close to it. The state passed a budget and an income tax increase last summer. But Glasgall points out more revenue will likely be necessary going forward. The survey of all 50 states found some are better than others when it comes to budget forecasting, putting money aside and paying down long term debts like public pensions. But Illinois was among the worst states overall in most categories. Glasgall is especially critical of how Illinois handles what are called legacy costs like state employee health care and pensions. Basically services the state consumed, but didnt pay for and either put it on a credit card or just pushed the expenditure off, he said. Illinois has among the most underfunded pension system in the country. When it comes to recommendations, Glasgall said Illinois needs to stick to paying bills in the year they come due. He said the state could also raise money by broadening its sales tax base and reviewing tax incentives to make sure they are working as intended. Glasgall said the report did find one bright spot. He said Illinois does pretty well when it comes to transparency, earning a C grade. He says at least the state shows how bad things are.
263 Judge Denies Equal Locker Room Access For Transgender Student, Cites Illinois Law 5 min Linda LuttonWBEZ Palatine High School student Nova Maday in 2017. Madays request for unrestricted access to the school locker room was denied on Thursday. A transgender student from Palatine who had sued her highschool district for full and unrestricted access to the girls locker room lost in court on Thursday.   A Cook County Judge Judge Thomas Allen ruled against Nova Maday , an 18yearold senior in Township High School District 211 in the northwest suburbs. Maday was born a boy but has lived as a girl for at least three years. She sued the district last fall in a bid to win unrestricted access to the girls locker room. It is the districts second big case involving a transgender student fighting for locker room access. District 211, with schools in Palatine, Schaumburg, and Hoffman Estates, is the largest high school district in the state.     WBEZ education reporter Linda Lutton explains the judges ruling and its implications. On what is allowed regarding locker room access in District 211 The district allows transgender students like Maday to use the locker room or bathroom facility that matches their gender identity. Nova was offered that access. But the district requires that transgender students agree to change behind privacy stalls in the locker rooms  and transgender students are the only students who must agree to use these stalls when changing. Maday and her lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union argued that ostracized her. It felt like discrimination and segregation. On the judges decision Judge Allen called this case the balancing act of all balancing acts. He seemed sympathetic to the fact that the school district faces demands from transgender students like Maday, who want broader access. But the district has also been sued by a group called Students and Parents for Privacy. That group doesnt want transgender kids in the locker rooms at all. They say transgender students should use private bathrooms. Schools should never be forced to give male students unrestricted access to areas where girls are changing clothes, said Thomas Brejcha, chief counsel for the Thomas More Society, which represents the District 211 privacy group. Claiming a female gender identity doesnt change that. The judge made his decision based on a strict reading of the Illinois Human Rights Act, which is meant to prohibit discrimination. Generally, the act guarantees full and equal access in all settings. However, the judge pointed to a 2010 amendment to the act that applies only to schools. That language guarantees access, but not full and equal access. The judge said he couldnt guess why Illinois lawmakers made a distinction for schools, only that he was basing his decision on the plain language of the law. On how the various sides reacted The school district said the decision upholds the balance its been trying for in serving all its 12,000 students. Superintendent Dan Cates said the district has an unwavering commitment to respecting all students, while also safeguarding student privacy. The ACLU said it was extremely disappointed in the decision. Spokesman Ed Yohnka said it brought up a bigger question. After years and years of hardfought efforts to ensure that we have a Human Rights Act that protects against discrimination in the state of Illinois ... we are now being told there is a place where that discrimination is permitted, and that is in our public schools, Yonka said. And I think that is something that frankly ought to alarm people. On what the ruling means for Maday, as well as for other school districts and transgender students For Maday, it means she wont get to take gym class in this last semester of her senior year  at least not with access to the locker room in the way she wanted. All I want is to be accepted by my school for who I am  a girl, Maday said in a statement issued after the ruling. Thursdays decision reaffirms the practices in School District 211, but it has no impact beyond the district. Thats actually a difficult situation for school districts. Many find themselves confronted with similar issues  balancing demands for access for transgender students with privacy concerns brought by other parents or students. The Obama Administration had given school districts guidance about accommodating transgender students. But that guidance was retracted by the Trump Administration. There are other, similar cases to Madays around the country. Theyre in state courts and federal courts, and these courts are sometimes issuing conflicting decisions. Many school districts have said they would like the courts to weigh in on this, and theyd like a definitive decision. Linda Lutton covers education for WBEZ. Follow her on Twitter at @WBEZeducation .

265 Josh McDaniels, John DeFilippo both praise Bears and Ryan Pace for hiring process - Chicago Tribune Two of the six candidates the Bears met with in the hiring process that led to the selection of Matt Nagy as head coach are gearing up for Super Bowl LII in three days.Had the Bears set their focus on Eagles quarterback coach John DeFilippo or Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, the soonest they could have hired the coach would have been the Monday after the Super Bowl. General manager Ryan Pace went with Nagy, the former Chiefs offensive coordinator, and things are settling into place at Halas Hall.McDaniels is expected to be named the new coach of the Colts next week and DeFilippo, who is coming out of contract, has been linked as a candidate to replace Pat Shurmur as the Vikings offensive coordinator. McDaniels was buttoned up when asked about his meeting with the Bears and what background his brother Ben, an assistant on John Foxs staff, was able to provide.Look, all the people that came were really impressive, Josh McDaniels said. Id rather not get into that at this point. Im kind of focused on this week and this game. Those people were great. Mr. McCaskey, Ryan Pace, they did a great job, and they picked a great coach.DeFilippo, 39, who emerged as a hot candidate this year after working two years with Carson Wentz, was much more engaging on the process.I had a great meeting with the Bears and I had a fantastic time talking football, DeFilippo said. The interview lasted probably about five, 5frac12 hours, but it felt like it was about half an hour because thats how smooth it went. Ryan Pace was unbelievably organized and had done a ton of background work on me. Knew a ton about me. I had done my background work on them, so it was very, very smooth dialogue.I thought I did a very good job of explaining how I see a football program being run, everything from the team to nutrition, sports science, all of those things. At the end of the day, they chose a great football coach in Matt Nagy.As part of his research, DeFilippo studied up on quarterback Mitch Trubisky and liked what he saw.I always keep an eye on those guys from afar, he said. You have to in terms of your future employment, their future employment, trades. The NFL is a fickle business and youre going to be coaching someone or they are going to be on your team before you know it. You always keep an eye on guys. I had watched Mitch coming out of college a good deal. I wouldnt say a great deal because we already had Carson. ... We didnt go through that whole process with Mitch, but I really liked him on tape.DeFilippo was also considered by the Cardinals before they hired Steve Wilks. It wasnt DeFilippos first time interviewing for a top job. The 49ers met with him in 2016 before hiring Chip Kelly. Landing with the Eagles when he didnt get that job has put him back in the spotlight again quickly.Its like anything, the more atbats you have, the better you get at this thing, DeFilippo said. I felt this was my first real goround in terms of being kind of a serious player in the thing. I think I represented myself well and gained a lot of confidence. If the opportunity happens to come again in the future, I know I will be ready.bmbiggs@chicagotribune.comTwitter @BradBiggsThe Bears missed out on Patriots CB Stephon Gilmore in free agency last year.

269 Emirates Justifies Tying 71 year old Nigerian Onboard Flight To Chicago – MeenatNigeria.Com 0 comments Emirates airlines has justified the tying up of a Nigerian septuagenarian, Pa. David Ukesone onboard a Chicago bound flight from Dubai. Emirates in a statement by its media consultant in Nigeria said that the 71yearold passenger was restrained onboard its flight because he was unruly and forced his way into another passengers seat even after biting him. According to the statement, Emirates can confirm that Mr. Ukesone was a passenger on flight EK235 from Dubai to Chicago on 23 January, and that he had to be restrained by cabin crew members due to unruly behaviour during the flight. Despite the best efforts of our crew to intervene and reason with him, Mr. Ukesone repeatedly disturbed other passengers, refused to remain in his assigned seat, and forced his way into another cabin class. He also assaulted crew and bit another passenger. As a consequence, he was restrained by our crew. Our cabin crew is highly trained to ensure the safety and security of our passengers, and constantly monitored Mr. Ukesones welfare throughout the flight. The safety and security of our passengers and crew is of the utmost importance and will not be compromised. Upon arrival at the airport, the passenger was handed over to the authorities in Chicago. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the other passengers on the flight for their understanding, in particular, the individuals who had assisted our crew during the flight. Ukesone had alleged that a flight crew bound, punched, taped his mouth shut for hours onboard a Chicagobound flight he was taking to reunite with his family. He said the flight was eight hours away from landing at Chicagos OHare International Airport, before the onboard incident.

272 New gadgets that take smart homes to the next level – Chicago Daily Herald Posted by: Admin If you have ever wanted to experience zero gravity but cant afford a trip to the moon, the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas may have a solution. A new bathtub gives the feeling of weightlessness while users bathe by mimicking the natural position of astronauts when they float in lowgravity conditions. If weightlessness isnt for you, there are plenty of other smarthome gadgets that can bring your living spaces to the cutting edge of home design. Many of this years products demonstrate that smarthome technology is no longer restricted to performing one isolated task. Theres a door alert system that not only provides LED nightlights but also extends the range of your homes WiFi. A voiceactivated smart mirror can change the lighting to preset options, tell you todays weather and traffic, and play music from your favorite Internet stations. Jesse Lemel, senior product manager at Kohler, explained why manufacturers are designing products that fulfill more than one function. We know from our market research you dont have enough counter space today and you dont have enough outlets today, Lemel said. Do you really want to take up that countertop space and that outlet so you can add this feature Or would you rather seamlessly integrate it Fully integrated home security systems are another prominent trend in the smarthome space, with one brand incorporating security features even though it isnt traditionally considered a home security company. The automatic lighting system has a button that allows homeowners to quickly turn on preselected lights if they hear an intruder. In designing the new gadgets, Lemel said, tech firms are trying to devise how do you take known, little, everyday things to make that experience a little bit better Here are some of the new home devices introduced at the CES: The ADT Video Doorbell can be controlled by an app.  MUST CREDIT: ADT Home Security  ADT Security Services introduced its Video Doorbell that will integrate with the rest of the home security products under the ADT Pulse brand. Locking or unlocking doors and activating the wholehouse alarm system can be controlled via the mobile app.  A new conversion kit from Kwikset lets you turn traditional door locks into smart locks you can control from any Internetconnected device. The ZWave technology is compatible with several major lock brands, not just Kwikset, and allows users to monitor which doors are locked as well as provide remote entry to their home for visitors.  The Casta lighting system by Lutron combines making life easier with several security features. In addition to customizing lighting preferences and schedules, the device has an All On bedside button option that turns all the preselected lights in the house to ward off intruders. It also can turn lights on and off randomly to make it appear that someone is home. The lighting system also integrates with Nest Thermostat and smoke alarms. If the alarm is triggered, blinds will open and lights will turn on automatically so people can see their way to escape.  Ring, the home security company once known only for its line of video doorbells, has unveiled a full suite of monitoring devices that integrate with their new app. This includes a set of battery powered and motionactivated outdoor lights that integrate with the alarm and cameras to send alerts to the users mobile device. It also includes motionactivated cameras some of which can be battery powered, flood and freeze detectors, smoke and carbon monoxide sensors and a discreet control hub that integrates all the systems.  The home security system Vivent previewed its Streety that lets neighbors upload recordings from their security cameras to share with other approved users they must live within a 300yard radius. Users can attach messages to the recordings to start a conversation about the recorded event as well as request footage from other users for specific dates and times. The app will debut this spring.  Beam, one of several homemonitoring devices showcased by Zmodo, sends alerts to a mobile device when doors are open including interior doors, extends a homes WiFi range and provides LED night lighting in three color options. The Carrier ductless air conditioner comes with a connected WiFi feature.  MUST CREDIT: Carrier HVAC Carrier introduced a ductless air conditioner with the highest efficiency rating on the market.

273 Put Down the Shovel, Your Heart May Thank You For It says Chicago Cardiologist Dr. Harry Cohen   Put Down the Shovel, Your Heart May Thank You For It says Chicago Cardiologist Dr. Harry Cohen The biggest snowstorm of the year is bearing down on the Chicagoland area and while outside may look like a winter wonderland, it could be creating a perfect storm for cardiac arrest. CHICAGO, IL,   The biggest snowstorm of the year is bearing down on the Chicagoland area and while outside may look like a winter wonderland, it could be creating a perfect storm for cardiac arrest. Shoveling can be a dangerous activity, causing approximately 100 deaths each winter . Most people underestimate how much shoveling can strain the heart, says cardiologist Dr. Harry Cohen of CardioMedical Associates, Ltd in Chicago. it can be especially dangerous for those who have or are at risk for heart disease. Shoveling, or pushing a heavy snow blower, can cause a sudden increase in blood pressure and heart rate while the cold air constricts blood vessels and decreases the flow of oxygen to the heart. Together, these two factors can trigger a potentially fatal heart attack. Those who have suffered a prior heart attack, smoke, lead a sedentary lifestyle or have a heart disease, high blood pressure or high cholesterol have an increased risk. Dr. Cohen advises against shoveling if you have a history of heart disease and advises everyone to be aware of the dangers of shoveling. Enjoy your day off and stay indoors instead of shoveling, Dr. Cohen says. If you must shovel, check out these tips from the National Safety Council for safe, heart healthy shoveling. Before Shoveling  Talk to your doctor and make sure its safe for you to shovel  Wait to shovel at least 30 minutes after waking up  Warm up muscles before shoveling by walking for a few minutes or marching in place.  Do not eat a heavy meal before shoveling  Do not drink coffee or smoke for at least one hour before or one hour after shoveling While Shoveling  Only shovel fresh, powdery snow as it is lighter  Push snow instead of lifting it. If you do lift it, use a small shovel and lift with your legs, not your back  Do not work to the point of exhaustion. Work slowly and take frequent, 15minute breaks  Drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration  Dress in layers and make sure your head, neck and mouth are covered  Watch for signs of a heart attack: lightheadedness, dizziness, shortness of breath, tightness or burning in chestneckarmsback. If you think you are having a heart attack, call 911. About Harry Cohen, M.D. Dr. Harry Cohen has practiced cardiology and internal medicine for 30 years and has served as a medical educator, researcher, lecturer and presenter at numerous conferences and symposia throughout his professional career. Since heart disease continues to be the largest health problem, statistically, facing both men and women, he is a strong advocate for the practice of preventive cardiology and believes that individuals with a family history of heart disease should begin cardiologic examinations, and embrace a hearthealthy lifestyle, while still in their twenties to prevent significant heart problems later in life. Dr. Cohen earned his Doctor of Medicine degree from New York Medical College in 1984 and pursued postgraduate study in cardiology and internal medicine at St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center in New York City. Dr. Cohen is licensed to practice medicine in New York, New Jersey, Illinois and New Mexico. He has earned a variety of medical certifications, including Diplomate, National Board of Examiners in 1984 Diplomate, American Board of Internal Medicine in 1987 Diplomate, Subspecialty Board of Cardiovascular Disease, American Board of Internal Medicine in 1989 and Diplomate of the National Board of Echocardiography with certification in Adult Transthoracic Plus Stress Echocardiography in 2009. He is a Fellow of the American Collee of Cardiology and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions. In addition to his private practice at CardioMedical Associates, Ltd., with Chicago offices at 2800 N. Sheridan Road, Suite 100, and 9000 S. Stony Island Avenue. Dr. Cohen has been an attending physician at St. Joseph Hospital in Chicago since 1990 Consulting Physician at Kindred Hospitals of Chicago since 1997 General Attending Physician at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center in Chicago since 1998 Associate Attending Physician, Swedish Covenant Hospital, Chicago, since 2000 and Attending Physician at North Shore Hospital in Evanston, Illinois since 2001. He also served as Associate Attending Physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago from 1998 to 2007 and Attending Physician at Holy Cross Hospital in Taos, New Mexico from 2008 to 2017. As an educator, Dr. Cohen served as Clinical Instructor of Medicine at Northwestern University School of Medicine from 1993 to 2007, and Clinical   University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine since 2008. Through his professional writings and lectures, he has addressed a variety of topics pertaining to cardiology, preventive cardiology, heart health, and the role of the internist in promoting heart health.

275 Trump sought release of secret Nunes memo, putting him at odds with Justice Department - Chicago Tribune On Wednesday, as Republicans were clamoring to make public a secret document they think will undercut the investigation into Russian meddling, President Donald Trump made clear his desire: Release the memo.Trumps directive was at odds with his own Justice Department, which had warned that releasing the classified memo written by congressional Republicans would be extraordinarily reckless without an official review. Nevertheless, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly relayed the presidents view to Attorney General Jeff Sessions  although the decision to release the document ultimately lies with Congress.Kelly and Sessions spoke twice that day  in person during a smallgroup afternoon meeting and over the phone later that evening  and Kelly conveyed Trumps desire, a senior administration official said.Trump and his Republican allies have placed special emphasis on the classified memo, which was written by staff members for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, RCalif., and suggests that the FBI may have relied on politically motivated or questionable sources to justify its request for a secret surveillance warrant in the investigations early phase. Democrats have characterized the memo as misleading talking points designed to smear the FBI. They said it inaccurately summarizes investigative materials that also are classified.Trump is inclined to have that released just because it will shed light, said a senior administration official who was speaking on the condition of anonymity to recount private conversations. Apparently all the rumors are that it will shed light, it will help the investigators come to a conclusion.The intervention with Sessions, which has not previously been reported, marked another example of the presidents yearlong attempts to shape and influence an investigation that is fundamentally outside his control. Trump, appearing frustrated and at times angry, has complained to confidants and aides in recent weeks that he does not understand why he cannot simply give orders to my guys at what he sometimes calls the Trump Justice Department, two people familiar with the presidents comments said.Such complaints, and Trumps repeated attempts to pressure senior law enforcement officials through firings or other means, have now become one of the main focuses of the investigation  including Trumps order last summer to fire special counsel Robert Mueller III, which prompted White House counsel Donald McGahn to threaten to quit before Trump backed down.Trump recently revived his complaints that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was not properly supervising Muellers probe, and suggested that he should fire Rosenstein  a highly controversial action against the person officially overseeing the special counsels investigation, an adviser who speaks frequently with Trump said.The president also made clear in recent days that he hopes that new questions facing the investigation allow him or his associates to make changes at the Justice Department, two people familiar with Trumps comments said.J. Scott Applewhite  AP House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, RCalif., returns to a secure area in the Capitol where his panel is interviewing former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon as part of its ongoing Russia investigation, in Washington, Jan. 16, 2018.House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, RCalif., returns to a secure area in the Capitol where his panel is interviewing former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon as part of its ongoing Russia investigation, in Washington, Jan. 16, 2018.J. Scott Applewhite  AP The president has told close advisers that the memo is starting to make people realize how the FBI and the Mueller probe are biased against him, and that it could provide him with grounds for either firing or forcing Rosenstein to leave, according to one person familiar with his remarks. He has privately derided Rosenstein as the Democrat from Baltimore. Rosenstein is not a Democrat. He was appointed as a U.S. attorney in Maryland by President George W. Bush and was kept in that post by President Barack Obama.One senior White House official said he personally had not heard the president make comments about getting rid of Rosenstein, which were first reported by CNN.A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.As Mueller narrows his probe  homing in on the ways Trump may have tried to impede the Russia investigation  a common thread ties many of the incidents together: a president accustomed to functioning as the executive of a private family business who does not seem to understand that his subordinates have sworn an oath to the Constitution rather than to him.On Wednesday, speaking briefly to reporters, Trump defended his actions in the probe as fighting back against unfair allegations. Oh, well, Did he fight back  Trump said. You fight back, Oh, its obstruction. The Russia probe has also figured prominently in Trumps souring relationships with some former allies and confidants. Trump first became enraged with Sessions after the attorney general recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation, which Trump thinks led to the appointment of Mueller. Later, after his former chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, accused Trumps eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and soninlaw, Jared Kushner, of a treasonous and unpatriotic meeting with a Russian lawyer in a new book, the furious president cast Bannon out of his orbit, as well.Sally Yates, the acting attorney general whom Trump fired early last year for failing to enforce his travel ban, said in an interview that Trumps behavior  from his June decision to call for Muellers firing to other meddling throughout the year  is beyond unusual and really dangerous.Karoun Demirjian Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have drafted a document they say will counter Republican efforts to discredit the FBI probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.The panels top Democrat, Adam Schiff , Calif., intends to ask the panel Monday to allow all House members...Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have drafted a document they say will counter Republican efforts to discredit the FBI probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.The panels top Democrat, Adam Schiff , Calif., intends to ask the panel Monday to allow all House members...Karoun Demirjian If you get to whats most essential and important and, I think, really damaging to our country, beyond just the confines of this administration, its this attack on our democratic institutions and particularly the Department of Justice, she said. It is a firm tradition at the Department of Justice that the White House just has absolutely no involvement in criminal investigations or prosecutions, period.She added: It seems like there are almost weekly efforts to try to get DOJ to open up a case on his former political rival. . . . The near daily attacks on the FBI  weve never seen anything anywhere close to this before.Indeed, Trump has shown a repeated pattern of attempting to regain control of the Russia investigation and deploy the Justice Department for his own protection and personal gain  comments and actions Muellers team could include in the obstructionofjustice portion of their probe.The problem, said Barry Bennett, a former senior adviser on the Trump campaign, is that subordinates sometimes confuse Trumps angry venting for actual administration directives.Some people still either dont understand the difference between the presidents bark and his bite, or theyre more than willing to take advantage of the bark to assume that it was a bite, Bennett said. Trust me, everybody on the campaign was fired more than once, but it never really happened.The arc of a potential case of obstruction of justice stretches back to the earliest days of Trumps presidency.In January 2017, at a oneonone dinner, thenFBI Director James Comey said, Trump told him: I need loyalty. I expect loyalty. A month later, in February, Trump dismissed others from the Oval Office and told Comey that Michael Flynn  Trumps former national security adviser who was fired for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russians  had done nothing wrong, according to Comeys testimony to Congress.I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go, Trump said at the time, according to Comey. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.Then, in phone calls in March and April, Trump told Comey that he needed him to lift the cloud of the Russia investigation and get out that Trump personally was not under investigation.And then on May 9, an angry Trump finally fired the FBI director.Shortly after dismissing Comey, the president asked Andrew McCabe, his acting FBI director, whom he voted for in the 2016 election, according to people with knowledge of the conversation. In December, when The Washington Post reported that McCabe intended to retire in early 2018 once he becomes fully eligible for his pension benefits, Trump took to Twitter to criticize him.A person who has spoken with Muellers team said investigators questions seemed at least partially designed to probe potential obstruction from Trump.The questions are about who was where in every meeting, what happened before and after, what the president was saying as he made decisions, this person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to recount a private session.This person added that while it seemed unlikely Muellers team would yield any evidence of a coordinated effort to aid the Russians  If you were on the campaign, you know we couldnt even collude with ourselves, he said  the investigators might find more details to support obstruction of justice.Rosalind S.

Helderman, Josh Dawsey By June, Trump had so openly begun discussing firing Mueller that Bannon and Reince Priebus, who was then chief of staff, grew incredibly concerned, huddling to strategize about how to dissuade the president and enlisting others to intervene with him.In midJune, Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of the conservative Newsmax Media and a longtime Trump confidant, voiced those concerns publicly, telling PBS NewsHour, I think hes perhaps terminating the special counsel.And that same month, Trump did, in fact, order McGahn to fire Mueller, a directive first reported Thursday by the New York Times. But McGahn told West Wing staff  though not the president  that he would quit before carrying out Trumps directive, and the president ultimately backed down, people familiar with the events said.Allies of the president said that his demands for absolute loyalty are not unreasonable  and not indicative of any attempts to obstruct justice. Of course the president ought to be able to expect loyalty, said Newt Gingrich, an unofficial Trump adviser. He is the chosen president of the United States by the American people, and he is the chief executive. If theyre not loyal to him, who the hell are they supposed to be loyal toIn recent weeks, Muellers team has questioned White House staff about the June episode in which Trump expressed interest in firing Mueller, a person familiar with those interviews said.Mueller has also asked about Trumps repeated outbursts against his attorney general, including a moment in late July when Trump nearly ousted Sessions out of anger at the Russia probe. Although McGahn had called Sessions at Trumps request in early March to urge him not to recuse himself, Sessions stepped aside that same day  and the president was furious.By July 19, Trump was venting publicly, telling the Times that it was very unfair of Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia investigation and that he would not have nominated Sessions to be attorney general if he had known of his plans.The next day, facing Trumps public criticism, Sessions announced that he would remain attorney general as long as it is appropriate. That same day, a White House adviser told a Post reporter that Trump was stunned that Sessions had not yet quit. The president, this adviser added, has been hoping that Sessions would be embarrassed enough by Trumps scathing public remarks to leave on his own.Shortly after, Trump issued a directive to Priebus: Go to Sessions and secure his resignation, according to two people with knowledge of the episode.But Priebus hesitated, declining to outright ask Sessions to quit and instead working to manage Trumps anger, those two people said. In the following days, Republicans rallied to Sessions defense, and Trump backed off.A person who has interacted with Muellers team said the prosecutors seem to be pursuing a theory that Trumps actions over months have followed a consistent pattern. Their theory appears to be that he goes after people who are not loyal, this person said. He wants in place people who are loyal, to make sure he doesnt get in trouble in the investigation.Karoun Demirjian, Josh Dawsey and Craig Timberg Top Democrats on Tuesday called on Facebook and Twitter to investigate what lawmakers said are Russian efforts to promote the release of a classified Republican memo criticizing the FBI probe of Russias meddling in the 2016 campaign.ReleaseTheMemo and other hashtags have been trending on Twitter...Top Democrats on Tuesday called on Facebook and Twitter to investigate what lawmakers said are Russian efforts to promote the release of a classified Republican memo criticizing the FBI probe of Russias meddling in the 2016 campaign.ReleaseTheMemo and other hashtags have been trending on Twitter...Karoun Demirjian, Josh Dawsey and Craig Timberg This person added that key episodes in this narrative include Trumps order that Sessions not recuse himself from the investigation the firing of Comey his efforts to intervene to get the Flynn investigation dropped and then, above all, Trumps dictation aboard Air Force One in July of a misleading statement to be released by his son, Don Jr., about his meeting with the Russian lawyer at Trump Tower during the campaign  the most obvious obstructive act, this person said.To prove obstruction of justice, Mueller would have to show that Trump didnt just act to derail the investigation but did so with a corrupt motive, such as an effort to hide his own misdeeds. Legal experts are divided over whether the Constitution allows for the president to be indicted while in office. As a result, Mueller might seek to outline his findings about Trumps actions in a written report rather than bring them in court through criminal charges. It would probably fall to Rosenstein to decide whether to submit the report to Congress, which has the power to open impeachment proceedings.As Trump faced growing questions about myriad concerns from his June directive to fire Mueller to his more recent grousing about Rosenstein, the White House was largely silent.

The fans were notified of the decision directly by the Blackhawks.  
281 Illinois Newspapers Illinois Newspapers Newspapers can be a valuable resource because they often publish marriage, divorce, death, and funeral notices as well as obituaries. The notices may include names, including maiden names and parent names, dates, and places. Death notices and obituaries often name living relatives. Newspapers also publish articles of local interest that often cover religious and social events in the community and include the names of people involved. Some newspapers serve several communities and devote columns to the everyday happenings in the area. They also include legal notices, estate sales, and advertising for local businesses. One strategy for using newspapers in research, is to select a time period for which your ancestor lived and begin by looking for obituaries as well as birth, marriage, and death notices. Read all the articles which were generated in the county where your ancestor lived, especially articles which give information about the church and schools where your ancestor may have attended.

282 NCAA denies Notre Dame&amp;apos;s appeal of 21 vacated football wins from 2011-12 - Chicago Tribune Notre Dame s president released a scathing criticism Tuesday of the NCAA s denial of the schools appeal to have 21 football victories from 2012 and 2013 restored.The Irish must vacate 12 wins from 2012  the season in which they appeared in the BCS title game  and nine from 2013 because of academic misconduct after a ruling by the NCAA Division I Infractions Appeals Committee.We are deeply disappointed by and strongly disagree with the denial of the universitys appeal, the Rev. John I. Jenkins, Notre Dames president, wrote in a statement. Our concerns go beyond the particulars of our case and the record of two football seasons to the academic autonomy of our institutions, the integrity of college athletics and the ability of the NCAA to achieve its fundamental purpose.A school investigation into academic dishonesty before the 2014 season led to the suspensions of former players KeiVarae Russell, DaVaris Daniels, Ishaq Williams, Eilar Hardy and Kendall Moore. Hardy returned later that season, and Russell returned for the 2015 season.The NCAA originally announced its penalties  which included one year of probation and a 5,000 fine along with the vacated victories  in a Nov. 22, 2016, ruling by the Committee on Infractions. The panel said a former Notre Dame student trainer violated NCAA ethical conduct rules when she committed academic misconduct for two football studentathletes and provided six other football studentathletes with impermissible academic extra benefits.Notre Dame appealed the penalty of vacated victories shortly thereafter.In its ruling announced Tuesday, the appeals committee said that the panel had the authority under NCAA rules to prescribe penalties for academic misconduct violations, that it confirmed at the time of the violations, the athletic training student was considered a university employee under NCAA rules, and that imposition of the vacation of wins would not have been an abuse of discretion given the other violations.Jenkins took issue on several fronts.In academic misconduct cases, the penalty of vacation of team records has, until now, only been applied in the case of serious forms of institutional culpability: when coaches, administrators or persons with academic responsibilities are complicit in cheating, or when an institution fails to monitor or lacks control over its athletics program, Jenkins wrote.In Notre Dames case, two of the students had received assistance from a fulltime undergraduate student who had parttime employment as an assistant to our athletic trainers. Studenttostudent cheating is not normally within the NCAAs jurisdiction, but the NCAA concluded that the students role as a parttime assistant trainer made her a representative of the institution and justified a vacation of team records penalty in this case.Jenkins wrote that the committee didnt explain why it viewed the student trainer as an institutional representative.This is more disturbing given that, in 2016, the member institutions of the NCAA amended the academic misconduct rules to make clear that students who serve in roles identical to that of the student in our case would not be considered institutional representatives, Jenkins wrote. If the committee members chose to depart both from precedent and the position adopted by the NCAA membership, it was incumbent on them to offer an explanation. They did not.Jenkins also wrote that the NCAA lacked rational explanation while addressing the three players ruled ineligible while competing.When these studentathletes competed in 2012 and 2013, the university correctly certified to the NCAA that they were eligible to compete, Jenkins wrote. After the cheating was discovered and the cases adjudicated by the University Honesty Committee in 2014, a framework was painstakingly created to recalculate grades so that students understood the consequences of their actions and did not benefit from them. In the curious logic of the NCAA, however, it is precisely the application of our Honor Code that is the source of the vacation of wins penalty, for the recalculation of the grades in 2014 led to the three studentathletes being deemed ineligible retroactively.To impose a severe penalty for this retroactive ineligibility establishes a dangerous precedent and turns the seminal concept of academic autonomy on its head.Although he didnt directly name North Carolina, Jenkins later referenced another recent highprofile academic misconduct case.The notion that a universitys exercise of academic autonomy can under NCAA rules lead to exoneration  or to a severe penalty  without regard to the way in which it is used defies logic and any notion of fundamental fairness, Jenkins wrote.Jenkins asked the NCAA to work with institutions to establish policies to address academic dishonesty and reform its enforcement process to provide a level of transparency, consistency and fairness that it currently lacks.What is at stake here is the academic autonomy of our institutions and the integrity of college athletics, Jenkins wrote.lpope@posttrib.comTwitter @lamondpopeRich history helps Notre Dame land fourstar receiver Kevin Austin Notre Dame signing day recap: 27player class ranks 10th nationally What is Loyola basketballs Wall of Culture Its a guide to the teams remarkable season.

284 Mayor pushes for Springfield to annex Illinois State Fairgrounds Mayor pushes for Springfield to annex Illinois State Fairgrounds Friday Feb 2, 2018 at 7:08 AM Feb 2, 2018 at 10:27 AM   Springfield Mayor Jim Langfelder is lobbying local legislators to let the city annex the State Fairgrounds and use some city sales tax revenue generated there to make repairs to several of the 170 buildings. The Coliseum, which normally hosts horse shows yearround, has been closed since October 2016 after structural damage to its roof made it unsafe for use. Building 29 and Barn 38 are closed, as well, and it was announced in January that Barn 13 needed emergency repairs. Langfelder said local lodging establishments have told him that canceling horse shows has meant a 25 percent reduction to their business. He bemoaned the domino effect on local shops and restaurants, as well. Once you lose the horse shows, its hard to get them back, Langfelder said. Its absolutely an economic hit for us. Eventually, with grounds annexed into the city, it would be able to switch over City Water, Light and Power as its utility, which would mean technicians close by if there were any outages, Langfelder added. Budget director Bill McCarty said in 2015, just special events on the state fairgrounds generated about 146,000 in sales taxes for Sangamon County, according to information the city received from the state Department of Revenue via a Freedom of Information Act request. The city already gets about 100,000 from the state to pay for fire protection for the grounds, he added. Repairs to the 101yearold building could cost up to 3.7 million, according to a 2016 report by Hillsboro engineering firm HurstRosche. To install airconditioning and heating capabilities could be about another 3 million, according to Illinois Fairgrounds Foundation Board chair John Slayton. Gov. Bruce Rauner created the foundation the same year the Coliseum closed to raise private funds for repairs. Slayton said the foundation has raised about 30,000 so far, though none of it has been awarded to either the fairgrounds in Springfield or Du Quoin. He added that the foundation is close to finalizing a deal on naming rights to the coliseum that will provide it with the capital it needs to be fixed. Slayton said the foundation hasnt taken a stance on Langfelders idea, though he said that the foundation and the governor have fixing the Coliseum as their No. 1 priority. There is about 180 million backlog of maintenance repairs for both fairgrounds, he said. There are 170 buildings out there and each one needs some kind of repair, Slayton said. The Du Quoin State Fairgrounds were annexed into the city of Du Quoin in 1972. However, the move was prior to state ownership, according to Morgan Booth, Illinois State Fairgrounds spokesperson. State Rep. Tim Butler, RSpringfield, said he would need more details before he could make a judgment on Langfelders proposal. Im open to all sorts of ideas, Butler said. ... Specifically for this idea of annexing the fairgrounds into the city, you need everyone at the table talking about it  the county, the city and the state. Other ideas on Langfelders wish list include the legislature granting Springfield an exemption to a state law that only allows changes in tax collection at the beginning of January and June. Langfelder wants the state to let Springfield begin collecting increased sales tax and telecommunication taxes in March, if aldermen pass either measure. The city is facing a possible 11.5 million budget hole, and three months worth of increased sales tax is about 1.2 million. Butler said he told Langfelder in a meeting that pushing up the increased tax collection implementation date from June to March wasnt viable. Its a large ask of the members of the General Assembly to go on the record for a tax increase for one municipality during an election year, Butler said.   Never

287 Illinois Democratic congressman faces challenge from left LA GRANGE, Ill. AP  A Lipinski has represented whats now Illinois 3rd congressional district since U.S. Rep. Dan Lipinskis father was first elected more than three decades ago. Now the younger Lipinski, a seventerm incumbent known as one of Congress most conservative Democrats, is facing a tougherthanusual primary challenge from the left flank of his party.Political newcomer Marie Newman says Lipinski, who opposes abortion and voted against President Barack Obamas 2010 health care overhaul, no longer reflects the Chicagoarea district, which supported Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primary.Newman has the backing of abortion rights and progressive groups and some of Lipinskis Democratic colleagues, including U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, as Newman looks to end what shes dubbed the Lipinski monarchy.Folks are fed up, and were going to make a change, right now, the small business owner from LaGrange said during a recent campaign stop. She pledged to represent trueblue Democrats by pushing for a 15 minimum wage, health care for all and protections for immigrants and refugees.Lipinski says hes worked hard for the district, which includes parts of Chicagos southwest side and suburbs including LaGrange and Brookfield, helping bring better jobs and transportation dollars. He notes its earned him support from labor organizations including the Illinois AFLCIO, which has about 1,500 affiliated unions statewide, though the Illinois chapter of the Service Employees International Union backed Newman.Im not just a show horse. Im a workhorse, he said. My constituents understand that because of that, Ive been able to deliver for them.The March 20 primary is one of several races nationwide this year in which progressives are targeting longtime Democratic incumbents. In New York, lawyer and businessman Suraj Patel, who worked on President Barack Obamas presidential campaigns, is trying to unseat Rep. Carolyn Maloney, who was first elected in 1992. Bostonbased software developer Brianna Wu, who spoke out about harassment of women in the tech industry during what became known as GamerGate, is running against eightterm Rep. Stephen Lynch.Many challengers, like Newman, say they were inspired to run after seeing people mobilize against the policies of President Donald Trump, or because theyre frustrated by the Democratic establishment.Lipinski describes the movement as a tea party of the left. He says the challenges  and an insistence that all Democrats must be in liberal lockstep on issues  is dividing Democrats and could ultimately hurt the party and its ability to regain control of the House this fall.He says that while his district has voted reliably Democratic, that could change if someone who is too liberal is elected.In 2016, the district supported Clinton with 55 percent over Trumps 40 percent  the lowest margin of any Chicagoarea congressional district represented by a Democrat. The same was true in 2012 and 2008.We really need to be united in fighting against President Trump, Lipinski said. If were focused inwards within our own party, that really prevents us from working to try to stop what president trump is doing.Newman isnt buying it.There is no tea party of the left, she says. There are trueblue Democrats that are trying to get democracy back in place.Defeating Lipinski wont be easy. His name is entrenched in the area, where his father was first elected congressman in 1982. William Lipinski served until 2004, when he stepped down after the primary, allowing Democratic Party leaders to put his son on the general election ballot in his place.Dan Lipinski won just more than half the vote in his first two primaries, with the other votes split between two other candidates in 2006 and three others in 2008. Since then hes either run unopposed or won every contested election by wide margins.This year the only person running in the GOP primary is an outspoken Holocaust denier.The Illinois Republican Party, which had unsuccessfully tried to recruit a candidate, denounced selfproclaimed Nazi Arthur Jones but determined it couldnt get him removed from the ballot. The party is now encouraging people to run as independents or writein candidates.Follow Sara Burnett on Twitter: https:twitter.comsara_burnett

And thats what hes doing.Pierce Colemans third quarter included a personal 90 run.My teammates really got the ball to me, Pierce said. We moved the ball around and I had open opportunities and took them.Coleman was one of the 12 Warhawks to score at least two points.For the last three games, were going 11 deep and I expected that from the start of the season and its coming around now, King Coleman said.Tyrek Cooper scored 10 points and Ricky Irby had nine points for the Warhawks.Andrew Hare and Dan Filippone scored 15 and 12 points, respectively, for Antioch 79, 24.North Chicago outscored Antioch 2710 in the second quarter to build a doubledigit lead.

296 Illinois agency picks Boston company for opioid helpline Illinois agency picks Boston company for opioid helpline 12618 12:51 PM BELLEVILLE, Ill.  The Illinois Department of Human Services has hired a Bostonbased company to run an opioid help hotline, despite receiving proposals from at least three Illinois providers. Gov. Bruce Rauner announced plans for the hotline last year. Its part of the states effort to combat the opioid epidemic. The 1.2 million program is being paid for through a federal grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The department searched for a provider that could operate the hotline at all hours every day and could handle 30,000 calls a year, the Belleville NewsDemocrat reported. Chicagobased Caritas, Chicagoarea nonprofit PilsenLittle Village Community Mental Health Center and the Iroquois Mental Health Center in eastern Illinois were among those that submitted proposals. But the state agency opted to go with Bostonbased Health Resources in Action. In their proposals, the agencies listed how much of the hotline budget would be allocated to personnel, fringe benefits, hotline equipment and other expenses. Health Resources in Actions said it would spend more than 515,000 to develop and maintain the hotline system by Texasbased Nebulogic Technologies. Health Resources in Action also planned a 65,000 marketing and communications budget and is working with the Public Health Institute of Metropolitan Chicago to promote the opioid hotline. Spokesman Patrick Laughlin said the department chose a vendor that didnt have a conflict of interest when referring individuals to treatment. Its imperative that the helpline remains impartial when referring individuals to treatment, and this aspect may have limited the number of Illinois organizations interested in responding to the request for proposals, said Laughlin. The hotline is available 24 hours a day. Its received 1,000 calls since starting.

297 Bulls&amp;apos; youth movement begins in earnest with Cristiano Felicio and David Nwaba given starting roles - Chicago Tribune Robin Lopez , Justin Holiday and Jerian Grant are out. Cristiano Felicio , David Nwaba and Cameron Payne are in.And the Bulls  rebuild remains centered on Zach LaVine , Kris Dunn and Lauri Markkanen.Thats the gist of executive vice president John Paxson s message to both his team and reporters before Tuesdays first postAllStar break practice at Advocate Center.Call it player development. Call it tanking. Call it both or whatever you want.To Paxson, its called good business for the final 25 games.You cant play 12 guys in our game. Nine or 10 is the most. And its just the position were in as a young team, 2037, with a lot of young guys and several who we havent really had the chance to see play much this year, Paxson said. For us to make the proper evaluation in terms of who fits us moving forward, this is something we have to do.Felicio and Nwaba will start alongside Dunn, LaVine and Markkanen on Thursday against the 76ers and, in Paxsons words, for a sufficient time moving forward, though he called the situation fluid. Payne will play backup point guard to Dunn over Grant, who will sit. Lopez and Holiday also will be cheerleading.Having played, I was out of the rotation several times. I know what its like to be asked to take a lesser role, Paxson said. Players have pride. So its hard. I dont take that lightly at all.But we have to look at the big picture. And thats what were doing. Its not easy as players. But one thing Ive been impressed by with this group all year is theyve bonded together, they like one another and they support one another. I dont see that changing.Paxson cited the development of Bobby Portis and Denzel Valentine as examples of what can happen when young players are given consistent minutes and opportunity. Nevertheless, Felicio has regressed this season and Paynes forcefed rotational turn last season fared poorly.What you hope for from a player standpoint is they gain some confidence in who they are, get comfortable on the floor and play well. I still think we have a lot of really good young talent, Paxson said. I think the exciting thing for us is for the first time were going to have a healthy Zach, Lauri and Kris. Theyre obviously the core.Along those lines, Paxson said he planned to talk to LaVine and the Bulls medical team about LaVine possibly playing the second leg of backtoback games. The Bulls have four more such sets.And both Paxson and Hoiberg said Dunn no longer would be on the 20minute limit that marked his lone game before the break following his 11game absence with a concussion. Hoiberg added the Bulls would be smart about Dunns usage in the initial postbreak games.As for Payne, who underwent surgery for the second time on a bone in his right foot last September, Paxson said the goal is simple.Especially when youre running with the second unit and the way Fred wants to play, play with pace, defend your position, compete every night and stay within yourself, Paxson said. His role is to get us into offense quickly and efficiently and make the right play with the ball. You dont want to be a high turnover guy.He got some G League games in, which was helpful for his conditioning. But he hasnt played basketball for a long time. And just as we talked about with Zach, there are going to be some ups and downs. Guys have to play through mistakes. But Cam has to run our team. We saw once Kris Dunn got his confidence and swagger back, he did a great job of running our team. Thats what Cam has to do in a backup role.Hoiberg is an organizational guy who has embraced his role in the rebuild following the trade of Jimmy Butler. Nevertheless, hes now in a position where, unlike most coaches, hes being told by management whom to play.I understand where we are right now as an organization, Hoiberg said. From my standpoint, it doesnt change our approach. And thats the important message to our players. We have to have great practices and great competition and play extremely hard once we step on the floor.Were going to try to put a game plan together to give our team an opportunity to compete to win. That doesnt change.kcjohnson@chicagotribune.comTwitter @kcjhoopBulls standard of play for stretch run remains same regardless of personnel That time Kobe Bryant almost became a Bull  the first time Bulls rookie Lauri Markkanen caps AllStar weekend with runnerup skills finish Seven things about NBCs Olympics coverage, including an idea for Scott Hamilton Sorry Elizabeth Swaney, Olympics should be reserved for the best athletes Bears decline 2018 option on guard Josh Sitton, who says he has prime years left in his career Privacy Policy Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Kris Dunn Chicago Bulls Cristiano Felicio Zach LaVine Jerian Grant Kobe Bryant John Paxson

299 &amp;apos;How does one airline run out of de-icer?&amp;apos;: Some gripes at Midway after Southwest&amp;apos;s cancellations - Chicago Tribune Midway Airport was abuzz Monday with harried Southwest Airlines passengers trying to get their destinations a day after hundreds were stranded when the Dallasbased airline canceled all flights due to trouble deicing planes.Seats were still hard to come by as passengers scrambled to rebook flights.More than 250 flights were canceled Sunday after the airline ran short of glycol, the fluid used to deice aircraft, and a pump on one of the glycol tanks failed, Southwest spokeswoman Lisa Tiller said in an emailed statement.The glycol has been replenished and the airport deicing equipment is fully functional, Tiller said. Mondays clear skies would also help the airline operate more than 250 flights out of Midway, she added. Southwest apologized to passengers for the inconvenience.Tiller declined to be specific about what measures were being taken to accommodate passengers, but she said that while Southwest doesnt typically offer gestures of goodwill as a result of weatherrelated events, the large number of cancellations in this case has the airline making additional considerations for impacted customers.Some passengers were frustrated, while others were philosophical about their unexpected extra day in Chicago.Nicole Riordan, was trying to get back to her Phoenix home after flying in Thursday for a birthday celebration with family and friends.The Oak Lawn native found out her flight was canceled Sunday when she checked her app just hours before she was set to depart.Riordan was puzzled by the reason for the cancellation. How does one airline run out of deicer Riordan said. That was a little upsetting.A student at West Coast Ultrasound Institute, Riordan said she missed classes Monday because of the flight cancellation.Her return journey could have been even rougher  and more expensive.Riordan first rebooked a return flight leaving Monday evening  with a stop in Denver  that would have gotten her home past midnight. She tried again and found an afternoon flight but said Southwest then hit her with a 100 change fee. She protested and the airline waived it.Jackie Potvin wasnt so lucky.In town from Westport, Mass., with her daughter and friends for a gymnastics competition at Navy Pier, she ended up paying 200 a night to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn near Midway and then spending 308 to book two tickets for herself and her 14yearold daughter on a JetBlue flight Monday so they didnt miss an extra day of school and work. If they would have given us a hotel voucher, it wouldnt have hit too hard, Potvin said. But when you have to spend another 400plus when it has nothing to do with the weather  Im not too happy with Southwest.But aviation consultant Michael Boyd noted that Southwests deicing debacle was likely a oneoff event that could only be blamed on Mother Nature.A little bit of ice will take an airplane out of the sky, Boyd said, so airlines are extra cautious when they run out of fluid. An airline can only store so much glycol at the airport, and the combination of several days of snowy weather and a mechanical malfunction exacerbated the problem for Southwest, he said.With Southwest being the largest carrier at Midway, it makes sense that the airline would be facing the debacle rather than smaller airlines who dont have as many flights coming in and out of the South Side airport, Boyd said.Its hard to anticipate this, he said. Its not like you can go to the deicing store and fill up. Today airlines take no chances.This is the second time this winter that Southwest has run into deicing problems.A few days after Christmas, 90 Southwest Airlines flights were canceled due to delays caused by the deicing of planes, according to a statement from the airline at the time. The airline blamed freezing conditions at the airport for slowing down crews in charge of deicing the planes.crshropshire@chicagotribune.comrchannick@chicagotribune.comkdouglas@chicagotribune.comTwitter @ corilynsRELATEDDeicing delays blamed for cancellation of nearly 90 flights at Midway Chicago records 9 straight days of snowfall, matching record 4 dead after shoveling, blowing or plowing snow in Lake County, Indiana John Hancock Center skyscraper losing its iconic name Land of Nod closes nearly all its stores, including 3 in Illinois Which city has the degree and talent edge for Amazons second headquarters Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Southwest Airlines
300 Dubuque Champps to close; Old Chicago to open Dubuque Champps to close Old Chicago to open BY JEFF MONTGOMERY jeff.montgomery@thmedia.com Save Champps Americana in Dubuque will close its doors this spring, and an Old Chicago restaurant will open in that space weeks later. Champps opened within the Best Western Plus, 3100 Dodge St., in 2008. The restaurant and bar will close at some point in April, according to Frontier Hospitality Group coowner Dan Huber. The group owns  and will continue to own  the Dodge Street property. Huber said Dubuquebased ROC Taproom purchased the assets of Champps and will convert the space into an Old Chicago restaurant. Founded in 1976, Old Chicago specializes in Chicagostyle pizzas, taproom classics and craft beer. It has more than 100 restaurants in 22 states. Huber said there are many similarities between Champps and Old Chicago, but he believes that the latter offers a particularly strong draftbeer selection, loyalty program and menu. In general, I think it is a stronger, more wellsupported concept nationally, Huber said. I think it will be very, very popular in Dubuque. He said just shy of 100 employees work at Champps. There will be no layoffs, and all employees will be hired at their current wage rate, Huber said. ROC Taproom acquired its first four Old Chicago locations in July, according to President Jeff Ruppel. It now owns four such restaurants in Iowa and one each in Illinois and Indiana. Ruppel is also the president of Parco Ltd., which owns 29 Wendys restaurants in Iowa, Illinois and Minnesota. He said he thinks area residents will quickly take a liking to Old Chicago menu items such as Italian nachos and Chicagostyle pizza. He hopes the restaurant also will tap into the areas interest in beer. We consider ourselves the beer authority and offer a great selection of beerfriendly food, Ruppel said. I think Dubuque is a perfect place for the restaurant, and I think people will be excited about it. The restaurant space will be closed for about three weeks when the new tenant makes renovations and trains staff on the new restaurant concept. The facility is in really great shape, but there still are some changes we need to make, Ruppel said. We are going to polish things up, put in some new furniture and change up the color schemes. The biggest thing will be revamping the kitchen to get in the equipment we need. Huber said the initial terms of the lease are for 10 years and the agreement could extend as far as 25 years. He noted that all events in banquet rooms within the hotel will be unaffected by the restaurant change. All gift cards to Champps will be honored by Old Chicago. The announcement of Champps impending closure comes just days before the restaurant chains 10th anniversary in Dubuque. Huber acknowledged that many customers will miss the restaurant, but he said the future of the space will be even brighter. Champps has had a terrific run and has been very well supported by the community, he said. It is fair to say it is one of the more popular restaurants in the Dubuque area. We caught a great wave with Champps, and we are hoping to catch an even bigger one with Old Chicago. Copyright, Telegraph Herald.

I am very scared due to my parents begging me not to go, saying how dangerous it is, and I have very little support. I am also sheltered, having grown up in suburban Florida. I was wondering if there is any Korean center to join, and if the city is as dangerous as everyone says it is I am a 52 girl, and very nervous Im actually from Chicago and Ive lived in various parts of the city. There are some areas where there is more intercommunal violence and also over policing but most parts are safe. If you think about how many people are in the city and the number of crimes that happen, its really not as dangerous as people make it out to be. People only really report the negative news because thats what gets ratings. From what I know, Ravenswood is a very quiet and lowkey neighborhood. Just dont do things like walk through alleyways and make sure to pay attention to your surroundings and youll be fine.I dont know about Korean centers but I think there is a part of the city that has a higher Korean population.

302 &amp;apos;Serial stowaway&amp;apos; grows agitated after judge orders a mental evaluation - Chicago Tribune The Chicagoarea woman who has earned national notoriety as a stowaway for sneaking onto jets without a ticket grew agitated Wednesday in court following her arrest for the second time in two weeks.The outburst by Marilyn Hartman, 66, came moments after a judge granted Cook County prosecutors request to evaluate her sanity and mental fitness to stand trial on felony theft charges.No I dont Hartman protested loudly, shaking her head, when her lawyer said Hartman had a family in answer to a question from Judge Adam Bourgeois Jr.When Bourgeois then asked if Hartman was under the care of a medical professional, her attorney, Parle RoeTaylor, began to say no, but Hartman, dressed in a jail uniform with an oversized jacket, again interrupted, crying out, YesHartman is being held without bail after she was arrested at OHare International Airport early Sunday after authorities spotted her in Terminal 3, just two days after a judge repeatedly ordered her to stay away from the airport. She was charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing and violating her bail bond.Earlier this month, Hartman managed to get past British Airways ticket agents and a Customs and Border Protection officer, boarded a jet without a ticket and flew to Londons Heathrow Airport in an empty seat.Hartmans court appearance Wednesday marked her fourth in just two weeks.After court, RoeTaylor vowed to seek an alternative to Cook County Jail for Hartman. She also told reporters that Hartman indeed has family members who did not attend court Wednesday.I do not believe she belongs in the criminal justice system, but here we are, RoeTaylor said. What I know is that the traditional way weve handled this case hasnt been the most successful, so perhaps we need to look at it differently.Hartman is scheduled to appear in court in midFebruary.The two recent arrests mark Hartmans first in Chicago since 2016, but she has a long history of trying to sneak onto airplanes.Hartman was given probation when she originally was sentenced after pleading guilty to a February 2016 trespassing charge, but she was sentenced to 364 days in jail a few weeks later, according to court records.At the time, Hartman had been living at a mental health facility on the Near North Side before violating the terms of her probation by leaving the facility and going to OHare.Hartman has been detained several times across the country for trying to bypass airport security.In a court filing after her arrest in July 2015 at OHare on trespass charges, Cook County prosecutors described Hartman as a serial stowaway.mcrepeau@chicagotribune.comRELATED:Serial stowaway arrested at OHare days after judge bans her from airport Serial stowaway sneaks onto OHare plane, flies to London: cops Serial stowaway gets 2 years probation, 6 months at mental health facility Chicago police commander gunned down in Loop pursuing a suspect Slain Chicago cop advocated for stiffer sentences suspect in his shooting is a 4time felon New York Times hired, then quickly unhired, writer who tweeted about befriending neoNazis Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Trials and Arbitration OHare International Airport London Heathrow Airport

Approach the operators and request for help to enable you contact the service provider. Since they are also looking for clients, they will readily help you with the required information.Know the hiring fees. The leasing rates vary between firms depending on a number of reasons. For instance, the length of contract, age of the teleporter, accessories to be attached and place in the country you live.

Moreover, you can do your booking online and make inquiries that maybe bothering you.Check the certification of the operator allocated to you. Operating the machine requires skills that one only acquires after undergoing training.

Moreover, request for the documents and confirm if they are legit, subsequently, you will have some peace of mind when you contract the firm.A contract will always protect your interests.

314 Slain Chicago Police Commander Was 31-Year Veteran Who Joined A Foot Chase Without Hesitation Chicago Police Commander Paul Bauers final act in a decorated career was to join fellow officers in a foot pursuit through the heart of his downtown district.Bauer, a 31year police department veteran, was shot and killed Tuesday afternoon while attempting to detain a suspect who was being pursued by a tactical team in the Chicago Loop. The commander, who happened to be in the area for a meeting, immediately responded to radio calls that a suspect was on the run nearby.Details of the incident remain unclear, but Chicago police say Bauer encountered the suspect in a stairwell outside the Thompson Center, a Loop office building that houses Illinois state government offices. A struggle ensued, and Bauer was shot multiple times.As news of Bauers killing spread, shocked colleagues mourned the loss of a veteran commander known as a steady leader who deftly handled the pressure of commanding police in the citys highest profile district. Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson offered condolences Tuesday night to officers under Bauers command.He was an individual defined by his decency and his sense of duty. He loved his family, he loved the Police Department, he loved the neighborhood of Bridgeport and he loved the city of Chicago, Emanuel said, according to the Chicago Tribune . I ask each of us, in the days ahead, if you see Chicagos officers doing their job, reach out to them as a member of your family. Thank them.Police took the suspect, who has not been publicly named, into custody Tuesday. As of Wednesday morning, formal charges had not been filed, but police said they expected to file charges within 36 hours. Meanwhile, investigators are reviewing video, social media, and evidence gathered from the autopsy, the Tribune reported .ALSO WATCH:Bauer is the first Chicago police officer to be shot and killed in the line of duty since 2011. He became commander of CPDs Near North District in 2016, following stints as the commander of the departments mounted patrol unit and as a tactical lieutenant on the citys near West Side.Bauer had recently criticized Chicagos justice system for what he saw as excessive lenience in prosecuting and jailing career criminals.Were not talking about the guy that stole a loaf of bread from the store to feed his family, Bauer told the Loop North News last year, according to the Tribune. Were talking about career robbers, burglars, drug dealers. These are all crimes against the community. They need to be off the street.The suspect in Bauers killing is a fourtime convicted felon, police said.Follow Will on TwitterSend tips to email protected .Freedom of Speech Isnt FreeThe Daily Caller News Foundation is working hard to balance out the biased American media.

319 WGN-AM named new radio home of the White Sox - Chicago Tribune Baseball is coming back to WGNAM 720 , named the new radio flagship of the White Sox on Wednesday.Get ready, kids, the sweet sounds of the ballyard return to 720 on Friday, February 23rd, live from Arizona, Todd Manley, WGN AMs station manager and vice president of content, wrote in a memo to staff.Ed Farmer is returning for his 13th season as a Sox announcer, teamed for a 10th season with Darrin Jackson.Under the multiyear contract, WGNAM will carry a weekly yearround program showcasing the team in addition to all regularseason and postseason Sox games, a pregame and postgame show and a selection of spring training exhibitions.Financial terms were not disclosed.Its a fantastic win for White Sox fans, Brooks Boyer, Sox senior vice president of sales and marketing, said in a statement. We are thrilled to team up with an iconic media organization in Chicago, delivering the hustle and passion of White Sox games to WGN radio listeners throughout the city and Midwest.The Sox had been poised to enter the third season of a sixyear contract with WLSAM 890, but a U.S. bankruptcy judge put the Sox rights up for grabs this month at the request of the stations parent company, Cumulus Media.Cumulus asked to nullify what it said were 20 or so extremely unprofitable contracts, including those with the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Bulls .That led the Bulls, who were in the second season of a fiveyear deal with WLSAM, to jump to Entercom Communications WSCRAM 670 in the middle of a West Coast trip this month.The Sox now shift to Tribune Media s WGNAM, which ended a 56year run as radio home of the Cubs in 2014. Tribune Media spun off its newspapers, including the Chicago Tribune, that same year.WSCRAM, now the radio home of the Cubs, broadcast the Sox for 10 seasons before their jump to WLSAM after the 2015 campaign.WGNAM already has the Blackhawks and Northwestern football and basketball. Tribune Media corporate sibling WGN9 is the Soxs broadcast TV home, complementing games on cables NBC Sports Chicago.The Sox regularly aired games on WGNAM between 1927 and 1943, with announcers such as Jack Brickhouse, Bob Elson and Quin Ryan behind the microphone. But that arrangement predated the team assigning exclusive rights, and its games aired on multiple Chicago stations.This deal comes as Marylandbased Sinclair Broadcast Group is seeking government approval to finalize its acquisition of Tribune Media, which Sinclair first announced in May.Bulls move to WSCRAM 670 WLSAM parent company asks court to end unprofitable White Sox, Bulls deals Paul Sullivan: White Sox deserve a better radio partner Reliever Joakim Soria arrives at White Sox camp to do what I do White Soxs first bullpen sessions of spring training Expitcher Esteban Loaiza to face charges of cocaine dealing Privacy Policy Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Chicago White Sox WGN Chicago Bulls Tribune Media Chicago Cubs Spring Training WGN Radio

<pre>[&#34;My View: 2011 worker&#39;s comp changes beginning to benefit Illinois My View: 2011 workers comp changes beginning to benefit Illinois Friday Feb 9, 2018 at 3:49 PM Feb 9, 2018 at 3:49 PM By John P. Scanlon In 2011, at the urging of the states leading business organizations, bipartisan majorities of Illinois lawmakers approved changes to Illinois workers compensation laws in an effort to reduce costs for Illinois employers. The legislation forced workers to forfeit longstanding rights in exchange for insurance companies being transparent with pricing and passing savings along to employers in the form of rate reductions. Unfortunately, the insurance companies are not holding up their end of the bargain. The National Academy of Social Insurance NASI, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization made up of the nations leading experts on social insurance, recently released a report examining the trend in Illinois following the enactment of a 2011 workers compensation overhaul. Whats clear is that Illinois has experienced substantial cost reductions in several areas. Total benefits paid to medical providers and money paid to compensate injured workers fell 19.3 percent between 2011 and 2015, NASI found. This is the second largest drop of overall costs in the country during that fiveyear period. Throughout the rest of the country, during the same time, the costs actually increased by 2 percent. Medical costs in Illinois declined 23.3 percent, representing the greatest decrease in the U.S. during the fiveyear period. Illinois also experienced the third largest decrease in benefits paid, compared to payroll. Though employers here have yet to realize the full benefit of the 2011 overhaul, because insurance companies are banking the savings as profit for themselves, NASI reported that Illinois saw the tenth largest reduction in employer costs, relative to payroll, for workers compensation during the fiveyear period. Employer costs here grew at just 3.8 percent while elsewhere across the country they grew by 21.6 percent. A coauthor of the NASI report said of the experience in this state: In 2011, workers compensation benefits paid per 100 covered wages were 10 percent higher in Illinois than in the rest of the U.S. in 2015 they were 13 percent lower. Costs to employers per 100 covered wages were 8 percent higher in Illinois in 2011 in 2015 they were 5 percent lower. While costs across the board have dropped dramatically, profits in the workers comp insurance market in Illinois have significantly increased during this time. In 2015, insurance companies had a profit margin of 17.2 percent, generating nearly a half a billion dollars. Insurance companies are taking advantage of both workers and employers. Notwithstanding the substantial fall in costs, there still are cries from the business and insurance industry demanding deeper cuts to the benefits injured workers receive. False claims that businesses dont come to Illinois solely because of our workers compensation costs are nothing more than a ploy to get lawmakers on board for taking away even more rights and protections that help lower and middleincome Illinoisans. The truth is, Illinois is good for business. It is home to 36 of the nations largest companies on the Fortune 500 list. Only three other states have more Fortune 500 companies. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Illinois is ranked fifth in the country for gross domestic product. Illinois is an especially attractive place for workers compensation insurers. There are 332 insurance companies writing workers comp policies in our state, which is more than in any other state. Illinois is desirable for these companies because there is little oversight and favorable laws that put their interests ahead of seriously injured workers and their employers. Reducing benefits to injured workers only shifts the cost of care away from insurers and onto the taxpayers while further padding the profits of insurance companies. It also would disincentivize employers from spending the money needed to ensure safe worksites and working conditions. Legislative efforts concerning workers compensation should focus not on further eroding the rights of the injured, but on improving workplace safety and providing meaningful oversight of workers compensation insurers.
